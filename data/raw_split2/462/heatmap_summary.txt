The study of Romanesque architecture heavily relies on surviving structures and related artifacts. Unlike potentially biased or incomplete written accounts, physical remains offer direct evidence of construction techniques, artistic styles, and societal influences, though careful consideration of subsequent alterations, material availability, and regional variations is needed. Primary sources of information about this era include the architecture itself, as churches, castles, and other buildings still stand across Europe, providing insights into the architectural principles of the era. The massive scale, rounded arches, thick walls, and small windows characteristic of Romanesque structures reflected a focus on stability and defense, as well as a limited understanding of structural engineering. Sculpture also plays a crucial role in understanding Romanesque architecture, as elaborate carvings adorned church facades, capitals, and other architectural features, depicting biblical scenes, moral lessons, and symbolic figures that communicated religious and social messages. In addition, manuscript illuminations offer another valuable source of information about Romanesque architecture through illustrated manuscripts, including depictions of buildings, architectural details, and construction scenes, as well as the role of architecture in religious and cultural life. Chronicles, histories, and other texts provide valuable context for interpreting the architectural evidence, helping to reconstruct the social and political circumstances that shaped Romanesque buildings, but it is important to recognize that written sources may be biased or incomplete. Despite these challenges, the study of Romanesque architecture has made significant progress, thanks to advances in archaeological techniques, art historical analysis, and architectural history.
