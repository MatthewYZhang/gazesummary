The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw a global expansion of coffee culture, changing it from a simple drink to a complex social trend that changed urban spaces, social life, and even economic systems. This change started with espresso drinks becoming popular. Espresso became a symbol of sophistication. The spread of machines that made it easy to prepare led to independent cafes. These cafes were created to resemble European cafes, where hanging out and talking was encouraged. These cafes also led to many coffee franchises opening, designed with a similar vibe but accessible to a wider range of customers.

What started as a simple drink has grown into a complex social phenomenon, impacting cities, social life, and financial systems. As people become more discerning and ethical, the coffee business will likely continue to develop. Coffee has become a powerful cultural force.
