Coral reefs are some of the most diverse and productive ecosystems, providing habitat for marine life, supporting economies, and protecting from storms. They are primarily found in warm, shallow tropical and subtropical waters. The foundation of a reef is built by coral polyps, invertebrates that secrete a calcium carbonate skeleton.  Over centuries, these skeletons accumulate, creating three-dimensional structures. The vibrant colors are from symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. These algae provide energy to the coral, and the coral provides protection and nutrients in return.  Climate change causes coral bleaching, where corals expel zooxanthellae, turning white and becoming susceptible to disease. Scientists and conservationists are working to mitigate these threats by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving wastewater treatment, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices. One approach is coral nurseries, where coral fragments are grown and transplanted onto degraded reefs. The future of coral reefs depends on addressing the threats they face.
