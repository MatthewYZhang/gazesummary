Cahokia, a Mississippian center of power, flourished in the Mississippi River valley between approximately 1050 and 1350 CE, becoming a large and influential urban center. The society was characterized by impressive earthen mounds, a complex social hierarchy, and trade networks.

Cahokia's rise was fueled by the fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River, which provided abundant agricultural resources such as maize (corn), beans, and squash, supporting a growing population. Its location at the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois Rivers facilitated trade and communication. Its influence extended far beyond its immediate surroundings through trade networks, facilitating the spread of Mississippian culture. The city's demise marked a turning point in the history of the Mississippian culture. Cahokia remains a testament to the ingenuity and complexity of pre-Columbian societies.
