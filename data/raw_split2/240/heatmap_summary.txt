The Maya civilization, which thrived in Mesoamerica between 250 and 900 AD, experienced a significant decline that led to the abandonment of major urban centers. One theory attributes this decline to environmental factors, emphasizing the Maya's dependence on agriculture, particularly maize cultivation. Population growth led to intensified farming practices, including deforestation and soil nutrient depletion. Additionally, prolonged droughts during the Terminal Classic period likely contributed to widespread crop failures, famine, and social unrest. Another perspective emphasizes the role of political and social instability. The Maya civilization consisted of independent city-states that frequently engaged in warfare, which could have disrupted trade networks, damaged agricultural lands, and led to increased casualties. Furthermore, a third hypothesis highlights the potential impact of demographic changes, including overpopulation, limited resources, and environmental degradation. Ultimately, the collapse was likely due to a complex interplay of factors. While major urban centers were abandoned, the Maya people did not disappear entirely, but rather migrated to other areas. Today, millions of Maya descendants continue to live in Mesoamerica.
