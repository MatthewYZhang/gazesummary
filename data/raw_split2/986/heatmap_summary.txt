Before the advent of writing, human societies used oral traditions, memory, and symbolic objects to transmit knowledge. The development of written language allowed the preservation and dissemination of information. The earliest forms of writing were primarily pictographic, using drawings to represent objects and concepts and Sumerian cuneiform evolved from this. Simultaneously, in Egypt, hieroglyphic writing emerged, combining pictograms and phonograms. The development of alphabetic writing made knowledge more accessible, facilitated trade and commerce, and fostered the development of law and literature. The Phoenicians developed the first alphabet, which was adopted and adapted by the Greeks. The Greek alphabet became the basis for the Roman alphabet. The invention of the printing press allowed for the mass production of books and led to an explosion of literacy. The rise of digital technology has made it easier to share information, but also presents challenges. Despite these challenges, written language remains an essential tool.
