The debate over nature versus nurture in moral development remains contentious. I argue that framing moral development as solely innate or learned is overly simplistic, suggesting a passive role for the developing individual. Instead, I propose that moral development is an active process, driven by complex interactions at multiple levels of cognitive and social experience. Some researchers argue that empathy is primarily innate, pointing to evidence that newborns exhibit primitive forms of emotional contagion. The interplay between genetic predispositions and environmental factors creates a dynamic developmental trajectory, and it is difficult to disentangle their independent contributions.
Moral development is not a passive process where either genes or environment solely dictate an individual's moral compass. During childhood and adolescence, individuals actively engage with their social environment, interpreting experiences and building a moral framework that guides their behavior. Therefore, understanding moral development requires a holistic approach, acknowledging the complex interplay of nature and nurture.
