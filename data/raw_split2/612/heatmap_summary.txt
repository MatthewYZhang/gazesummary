Coffee's journey began in the highlands of Ethiopia and evolved into a global commodity intertwined with trade, politics, and social changes. In the mid-15th century, Sufi monasteries of Yemen provided the earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking, where it was used to enhance concentration and wakefulness during religious rituals. Coffee then spread to Mecca and Medina, encountering initial opposition. By the 16th century, coffee houses became integral to urban social life in the Middle East, serving as centers for intellectual exchange and political discussions. Referred to as "schools of the wise," these coffee houses played an important role in the society.

In Europe, coffee's introduction occurred primarily through Venetian traders during the 17th century. Its popularity led to the establishment of coffee plantations in European colonies, particularly by the Dutch in Java and South America, resulting in Brazil's emergence as a major coffee producer by the 18th century. The rise of instant coffee and standardization occurred in the 20th century, although a counter-movement emphasizing quality and ethical sourcing emerged. Today, coffee culture varies globally, with espresso dominating in Italy and diverse coffee drinks catering to various tastes in the United States. The enduring appeal of coffee as a social lubricant and daily ritual is evident in the proliferation of coffee shops.
