Dams impact river ecosystems, and understanding these effects is crucial for water resource management and biodiversity preservation. Dam construction alters river flow regimes and seasonal variations in water levels. This disruption affects spawning migrations, seed dispersal, and life cycle events for aquatic organisms. Reduced flow velocities in reservoirs cause increased sedimentation and alter habitat.

Dams also act as barriers to fish migration. The article notes that species like salmon and sturgeon need unimpeded access to spawning grounds. Dams block these pathways, leading to population declines and local extinctions. Downstream riverbeds experience erosion from the altered sediment regime due to dams, trapping sediment and reducing its supply. Coastal erosion and the loss of wetlands can result from this sediment delivery. To mitigate these issues, water resource management should integrate ecological considerations for dam construction and operation, and prioritize biodiversity preservation.
