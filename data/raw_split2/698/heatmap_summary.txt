Flowering plants, angiosperms, dominate Earth's plant life, their success tied to pollinator interactions. While some plants use wind or water for pollination, most have intricate animal relationships—insects, birds, and mammals—for efficient pollen transfer. These often mutually beneficial, with plants rewarding pollinators with nectar or pollen.

These symbiotic relationships have led to coevolution, where plant and pollinator traits evolve together. This manifests in various ways, like flower shape and color, and pollinator tongue or beak length. For instance, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are bright, tubular, and nectar-rich, matching hummingbird needs.

However, this relationship faces threats from habitat loss, pesticide use, and climate change. Habitat loss reduces nesting and foraging sites, pesticides harm pollinators or their food, and climate change disrupts flowering and pollinator timing. This pollinator decline is concerning, impacting ecosystems and human food production, especially for crops like fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Efforts to protect pollinators involve habitat restoration, reduced pesticide use, and pollinator-friendly gardening.
