Coral reefs are vibrant underwater ecosystems that support a staggering array of marine life. These intricate structures, built by tiny coral polyps, cover less than 1% of the ocean floor yet provide habitat for approximately 25% of all marine species. They are vital to coastal communities, offering protection from storm surges, supporting fisheries, and driving tourism.

One of the most significant threats to coral reefs is rising ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with algae called zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues and provide them with energy through photosynthesis. When water temperatures rise above a certain threshold, corals become stressed and expel these algae, causing them to turn white, a phenomenon known as coral bleaching. While corals can recover from bleaching if temperatures return to normal, prolonged or severe bleaching events can lead to coral starvation and death. The loss of coral reefs also has significant economic implications, as tourism revenue declines. Despite these efforts, the future of coral reefs remains uncertain.
