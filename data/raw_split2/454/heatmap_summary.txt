The Cambrian explosion, a period of rapid diversification approximately 541 million years ago, saw the emergence of complex animal forms after a period dominated by single-celled organisms. Rising oxygen levels in the oceans are thought to have played a role, providing energy for larger organisms. The development of hard body parts also provided protection. The breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia and subsequent flooding created new marine environments rich in nutrients. The fossil record from the Burgess Shale provides compelling evidence of this diversification, revealing diverse body plans and strange organisms. The Cambrian explosion had a profound impact on subsequent evolution. The Cambrian explosion set the stage for the subsequent diversification of life and the emergence of the complex ecosystems that we see today. The exact causes of the Cambrian explosion remain a topic of ongoing research.
