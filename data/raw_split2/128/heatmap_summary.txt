Supermarkets have revolutionized food retail, impacting everything from agriculture to consumer behavior. Initially, food shopping was done in specialized shops like butchers and bakeries, which offered personalized service but had limited selections and higher prices. The early 20th century saw the rise of chain stores such as A&P, which introduced economies of scale.

Supermarkets emerged in the 1930s, offering a wide range of products under one roof with a self-service model that reduced labor costs and lowered prices. These stores sold meat, baked goods, canned goods and produce. The rise of automobile ownership, refrigeration, and post-World War II economic boom fueled their growth by enabling consumers to travel longer distances and demand convenience.

Supermarkets had a significant impact, pressuring farmers to produce more food at lower costs and influencing the development of food processing and packaging. They also contributed to urban sprawl and changed consumer habits. Today, supermarkets face challenges from online retailers and changing consumer preferences.
