The increasing demand for food due to a growing population and environmental concerns drives agricultural innovation. Vertical farming, a novel approach, cultivates crops in vertically stacked layers indoors. This technique is a solution for food security and environmental worries, leveraging technologies like controlled environment agriculture (CEA), hydroponics, and aeroponics. CEA regulates environmental factors to optimize plant growth and minimize resource use. Hydroponics and aeroponics enhance efficiency by directly delivering nutrients to plant roots, cutting down on water usage.

Vertical farming boosts crop yields, minimizes water consumption, and reduces the need for pesticides. It can be implemented in urban areas, reducing transportation costs and strengthening food security, but has high initial investment costs and significant energy demands. There are advancements in addressing this challenge and more research is required to expand the range of crops that can be grown. The potential of vertical farming to transform agriculture and enhance food security is undeniable and poised to play a crucial role in securing future food supplies.
