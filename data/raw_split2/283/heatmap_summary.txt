The mass movements of birds, or migration, have puzzled scientists for centuries. The precise mechanisms driving these epic flights remain a subject of ongoing research and debate. One theory is that birds migrate to exploit seasonal food abundances. As resources diminish in one location due to factors like winter weather, birds move to areas where food is plentiful, ensuring their survival and reproductive success. Some birds species migrate to areas with no apparent increase in food availability, suggesting that other factors are at play.

A recent hypothesis posits that migration is influenced by a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental cues. Birds are born with an innate drive to migrate, and this blueprint is fine-tuned by environmental signals. Research has shown that birds use a variety of cues to guide their journeys, including the Earth's magnetic field. Climate change and habitat loss pose increasing challenges to migratory birds.

The discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century revolutionized medicine, providing a powerful arsenal against bacterial infections. The widespread use of antibiotics has triggered a global crisis: the rise of antibiotic resistance. Overuse of antibiotics creates a selective pressure that favors the survival of resistant bacteria. Some bacteria produce enzymes that degrade or modify antibiotics, or possess efflux pumps that actively expel antibiotics from the bacterial cell. Antibiotic resistance is accelerated by the horizontal transfer of resistance genes between bacteria. Infections become more difficult to treat, leading to increased mortality. It also places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Efforts are needed to improve infection prevention and control measures.
