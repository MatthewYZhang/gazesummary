The introduction of non-native species to isolated environments, especially islands, is a significant driver of ecological change. Invasive species can arrive through various pathways, including deliberate introductions by humans, accidental transport, or natural dispersal. Once established, they proliferate rapidly, outcompeting native species for resources. Predators may decimate naive prey species, herbivores can damage vegetation, and diseases can spread rapidly. Rabbits in Australia have caused widespread damage to vegetation and competition with native herbivores, leading to soil erosion and declines in native populations. Miconia calvescens, a tree from South America, has invaded Pacific islands, forming dense thickets that shade out native vegetation. Combating invasive species requires prevention through biosecurity measures, early detection, and rapid response, including physical removal, chemical control, and habitat restoration.
