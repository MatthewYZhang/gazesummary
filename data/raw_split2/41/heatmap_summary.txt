Populism, an ideology that emphasizes the common person against the elite, has seen a resurgence in the 21st century. Defining populism is challenging, but core tenets include belief in the wisdom of the ordinary citizen, distrust of elites, and representing the marginalized. Populist leaders use emotionally charged rhetoric and simplify issues to cultivate shared identity. 

Several factors have contributed to this rise. Economic inequality and the 2008 financial crisis eroded trust, while social media allowed movements to bypass media. Cultural anxieties related to immigration have also been exploited. Populist movements can be left- or right-wing, focusing on economic or cultural issues.

Populism's impact on democracy is debated. Some see it as revitalizing by challenging power structures, but others worry about undermining norms. Populist leaders may exhibit authoritarian tendencies and employ divisive rhetoric. Ultimately, understanding populism is crucial for safeguarding democratic values and promoting social cohesion.
