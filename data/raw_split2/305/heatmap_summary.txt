Cahokia, the largest urban center of the Mississippian culture, thrived from about 800 to 1600 CE, reaching its peak around 1100 CE with an estimated population of 10,000 to 20,000. The most prominent feature of Cahokia was its massive earthen mounds, with over 120 once dotting the landscape. These mounds served as platforms for houses, temples, and council buildings. Monks Mound, the largest structure, covers 14 acres and rises 100 feet, representing the largest prehistoric earthen construction in the Americas and requiring significant labor and organization.

Agriculture was central to Cahokian society, relying on the fertile soils of the Mississippi River floodplain to grow crops like maize, beans, and squash. Around 1250 CE, Cahokia began to decline, eventually being abandoned by the 14th century. Various theories suggest environmental factors like deforestation, soil erosion, and climate change played a role in the decline due to depletion of resources. Warfare and competition with neighboring groups, along with the construction of defensive palisades, also contributed to the city's downfall. Today, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site attracts visitors worldwide to appreciate the grandeur of this ancient city.
