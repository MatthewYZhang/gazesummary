Johannes Gutenberg's printing press, invented in the mid-15th century, is a pivotal moment in history. Before its creation, information was shared through labor-intensive handwritten manuscripts, limiting access to the elite and religious groups. Gutenberg's press revolutionized information creation, storage, and distribution. Books were previously copied by hand, a slow and error-prone process that limited availability, often by monks. Producing a single manuscript was costly, hindering widespread literacy and education for the common person. Gutenberg combined existing technologies, like the wine press and movable type to create books efficiently, and allowed the mass production of books at a fraction of the cost. Its impact was immediate, spreading knowledge rapidly across Europe. The resulting increase in literacy fueled the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution. The printing press also impacted the Reformation. Finally, despite some criticisms, the printing press continues to transform society.
