The Cambrian explosion, a surge in the diversity of life on Earth, marked the emergence of most major animal phyla. Scientists are exploring the potential causes and contributing factors. Prior to the Cambrian, life was primarily composed of simple, single-celled organisms. The fossil record reveals a remarkable array of organisms with hard skeletons, segmented bodies, jointed appendages, and specialized sensory organs. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the Cambrian explosion. One leading theory suggests that a rise in atmospheric oxygen levels may have played a crucial role, providing the energy needed to support the more active lifestyles and larger body sizes of the newly evolving animals. Another hypothesis focuses on the development of predator-prey relationships. The Cambrian explosion provides insights into the processes that drive evolutionary innovation and shape the course of life on Earth. The animal phyla that emerged during this period have continued to evolve and diversify.
