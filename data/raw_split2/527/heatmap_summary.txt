Honeybee populations are declining due to habitat loss, pesticide use, diseases, and climate change. Habitat loss occurs as natural landscapes are converted for agriculture, urbanization, and infrastructure development, diminishing forage resources and replacing diverse floral sources with monocultures or barren landscapes, thereby limiting the nutritional intake of bees and weakening their immune systems. The loss of nesting sites exacerbates the problem.

Pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, also contribute to the decline as bees consume contaminated pollen and nectar. Implementing integrated pest management strategies and exploring alternative pest control methods are essential steps to tackle pesticide use. Diseases and parasites are crucial factors, with the varroa mite being a significant threat. Responsible beekeeping practices, like monitoring and treating infestations, are crucial. Altered weather patterns can disrupt the synchrony between bee activity and floral availability. Addressing climate change through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable land management practices can help protect honeybee populations from the impacts of a changing climate.
