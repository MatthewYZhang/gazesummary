Artificial light at night (ALAN), or light pollution, is increasingly recognized as a significant environmental stressor that impacts ecosystems. ALAN disrupts natural light cycles and has unintended consequences on flora, fauna, and ecological processes. The most obvious impact of ALAN is on nocturnal animals, and it can disrupt their behaviors in numerous ways. Moths, crucial pollinators and food sources, are drawn to artificial lights, leading to exhaustion, predation, and reduced pollination efficiency. Sea turtle hatchlings are disoriented by coastal lighting and wander inland, where they face dehydration and predation. Diurnal species are also affected because disrupted sleep patterns in birds can alter their singing behavior, impacting mate attraction and territorial defense. Light pollution reduction strategies include using shielded lighting fixtures, employing lower intensity lighting, and implementing lighting curfews. Failure to address the issue could lead to further declines in biodiversity, ecosystem degradation, and ultimately, a diminished quality of life for both humans and the natural world.
