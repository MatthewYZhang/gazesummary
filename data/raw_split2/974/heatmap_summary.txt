Megacities, urban centers exceeding 10 million residents, present challenges and opportunities due to their rapid growth. Economic opportunity is a primary factor driving the rise of megacities, with rural populations migrating to urban centers for employment, education, and improved living standards. However, the rapid growth can also outpace infrastructure and governance systems. This rapid growth results in issues such as overcrowding, inadequate housing, limited access to basic services, air and water pollution, traffic congestion, and waste management. These conditions degrade the quality of life for residents, and concentration of poverty and inequality can lead to unrest and crime. Air and water pollution and waste management issues can further degrade the quality of life for residents, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, and resource depletion. Managing this growth sustainably and equitably will require a multi-faceted approach that addresses economic, social, and environmental challenges. Investing in infrastructure and promoting sustainable development practices and international cooperation are crucial.
