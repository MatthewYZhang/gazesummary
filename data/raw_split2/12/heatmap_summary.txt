Cooperative breeding, where individuals beyond the parents assist in raising the young, has puzzled evolutionary biologists. The key question is why individuals forgo their own reproduction to aid others. Kin selection suggests that helpers increase their indirect fitness by aiding relatives, thus contributing to the survival of shared genes. This is seen in species like the Florida scrub-jay, where offspring remain with their parents, defending the territory and raising subsequent broods, boosting their parents' reproductive success.

Ecological constraints, such as limited breeding opportunities and harsh conditions, can also drive helping behavior, as remaining at home may be the best way to maximize long-term reproductive success. Harsh environments can make helpers crucial for offspring survival. Moreover, helpers might gain future reproductive opportunities, such as inheriting the breeding territory or gaining experience in raising young. The "pay-to-stay" hypothesis proposes that helpers pay "rent" by assisting, allowing them to stay on the territory and access resources, which is beneficial in resource-rich or high-predation areas. Reciprocal altruism, though less common, involves helpers expecting future assistance in return. The relative importance of these factors varies, with kin selection, ecological constraints, or future reproductive opportunities dominating in different species.
