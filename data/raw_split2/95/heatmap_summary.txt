The 21st century is witnessing increased urbanization, notably the rise of megacities with over 10 million residents, driven by economic, social, and environmental forces, which represent a shift in urban living. Economic opportunities in these centers serve as hubs for commerce, industry, and innovation, attracting individuals seeking employment and a higher standard of living. The concentration of resources like transportation, educational institutions, and healthcare facilities further fuels this growth, drawing migrants from rural areas.

The influx of people, however, puts strains on existing infrastructure, leading to overcrowding, traffic congestion, and inadequate housing. Environmental problems, such as air and water pollution, waste management issues, and the loss of green spaces, are often exacerbated. Addressing the challenges of megacity growth requires innovative and sustainable urban planning strategies, investing in public transportation, promoting affordable housing, creating green spaces, and implementing policies to reduce pollution. Sustainable urban planning, community participation, and global collaboration are essential for creating cities that are economically vibrant, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable.
