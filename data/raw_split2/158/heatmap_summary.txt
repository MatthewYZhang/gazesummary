The invention of photography in the early 19th century changed visual representation, offering accuracy and accessibility compared to the prior reliance on artistic skill and subjective interpretation. The groundwork for photography came from centuries of discoveries in optics and chemistry, with the camera obscura being known since antiquity. Scientists in the 18th century began experimenting with light-sensitive materials to capture images.

Nicéphore Niépce is credited with creating the first permanent photograph in the 1820s using a process called "heliography", which involved coating a pewter plate with a light-sensitive asphalt. Louis Daguerre continued this research and developed the daguerreotype, unveiled in 1839, which produced highly detailed images on a silver-plated copper sheet.

The daguerreotype rapidly spread worldwide, establishing photography as a medium for portraiture, landscape documentation, and scientific observation. The daguerreotype was expensive and produced single images, while the calotype invented by William Henry Fox Talbot used paper to create multiple positive prints. The mid-19th century introduced the wet collodion process, which combined the advantages of the daguerreotype and calotype. The development of photography revolutionized visual representation and had a profound impact on art, science, and journalism.
