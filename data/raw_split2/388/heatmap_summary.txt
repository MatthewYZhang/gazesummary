The decline and abandonment of the Maya Lowlands, a culturally rich region, represents one of history's enduring mysteries. Flourishing from 250 to 900 C.E., the Classic Maya civilization displayed impressive urban centers, intricate hieroglyphic writing, and sophisticated astronomical knowledge. However, from the late 8th century, these cities declined, leading to a widespread collapse by the 10th century, a phenomenon that historians have vigorously debated.

One prominent theory is environmental degradation, particularly deforestation driven by agricultural and fuel needs, which led to soil erosion, reduced rainfall, and decreased agricultural productivity. Pollen analysis supports the widespread deforestation in the late Classic period, which contributed to food shortages and unrest. Climate change, particularly a series of severe droughts, is also considered a factor, impacting agricultural yields and causing famine. While the Maya were skilled water managers, their systems were insufficient to cope with prolonged droughts. Recent research emphasizes the interplay of multiple factors like environmental degradation, climate change, political instability, and social inequality in the Maya collapse.
