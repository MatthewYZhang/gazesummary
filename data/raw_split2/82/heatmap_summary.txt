Zoos have transformed from mere menageries into active participants in conservation, research, and education, sparking debate about their impact and ethics. A significant contribution lies in captive breeding programs, which bolster dwindling populations of species threatened by habitat loss and poaching. These programs offer a safe environment for reproduction, increasing numbers and genetic diversity. Zoos often collaborate internationally, exchanging animals to maximize genetic variation and prevent inbreeding. Reintroduction into native habitats can restore wild populations, contingent on addressing the initial threats.

Zoos also engage in scientific research, enhancing our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and health, which is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Furthermore, education forms a vital function of modern zoos, which foster appreciation for biodiversity and conservation through exhibits and programs. Despite these benefits, zoos face ethical concerns regarding animal welfare in artificial environments, which can raise concerns. Zoos prioritize prioritizing animal welfare, promoting scientific research, and providing accurate and engaging educational experiences to ensure they are truly serving the best interests of both animals and the environment.
