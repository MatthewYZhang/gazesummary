Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, is famed for its moai statues but harbors a history of resource management and environmental degradation that led to the civilization's decline. Early Polynesian settlers arrived around 1200 AD, finding a subtropical paradise with the Easter Island palm, which provided resources for construction and food. The island's diverse birdlife was also a food source. As the population grew, the demand for wood to construct the moai led to widespread deforestation, as well as the need to transport and erect these statues. Archaeological evidence indicates a decline in palm tree pollen and an increase in grasses and shrubs. Soil erosion also increased. The overexploitation of resources is signaled by the decreasing amount of seabirds and land birds found. The Rapa Nui people attempted to mitigate the damage, but these efforts failed to counter the environmental impact, ultimately resulting in environmental collapse and societal decline. The story of Easter Island serves as a warning.
