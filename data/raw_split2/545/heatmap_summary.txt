The Maya civilization, known for its impressive architecture and advanced mathematics, experienced a complex decline influenced by environmental factors, political instability, and social changes. One crucial factor was environmental degradation. The Maya relied on agriculture, particularly maize cultivation, leading to deforestation, soil erosion, and climate changes like decreased rainfall and droughts. As the population increased, so did the demand for land, leading to deforestation and soil erosion.

Political instability, characterized by warfare among independent city-states, also contributed to the Maya decline. Constant warfare placed a strain on the economy, diverting resources from agriculture. The intensity of warfare increased during the Terminal Classic Period. Defensive structures became more common, and constant warfare likely disrupted trade networks, reduced agricultural productivity, and led to population displacement.

Social changes, including increased social inequalities and changes in religious beliefs, may have also played a role. The ruling elite may have become detached from the needs of the common people, leading to resentment and unrest.

The Maya collapse was a gradual process influenced by the interplay of environmental factors, political instability, and social changes.
