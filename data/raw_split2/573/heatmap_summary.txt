The evolution of perfume began with fragrances serving utilitarian and religious purposes in ancient cultures, where perfumes often consisted of simple infusions of flowers, herbs, and spices. Egyptians were particularly skilled in the art of creating perfumes, extensively using them in religious ceremonies and personal adornment. Later, the Islamic Golden Age marked a pivotal moment as Arab chemists refined distillation techniques, enabling the extraction of essential oils and introducing new ingredients like musk and ambergris. The use of alembic stills, pioneered by Arab scientists enabled the efficient extraction of floral waters and essential oils from plant materials, significantly advancing perfumery and laying the foundation for its development in Europe. During the Renaissance, perfumery flourished in Europe, particularly in Italy and France, with Catherine de Medici playing a role in popularizing perfume in the French court. Subsequently, the 18th and 19th centuries brought advancements in perfume technology and synthetic ingredients.
Grasse, thanks to its favorable climate for growing fragrant flowers like jasmine, rose, and lavender, emerged as the center of perfume production, with skilled artisans developing techniques for extracting essential oils. The development of synthetic musk, vanillin, and coumarin revolutionized the industry, and the late 19th century saw the birth of modern perfumery with complex compositions.
