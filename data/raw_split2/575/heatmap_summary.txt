The history of chocolate is intertwined with the rise and spread of cacao consumption in Europe. While originating in the Americas, cacao's transformation into a confection and beverage occurred primarily in Europe. Initially met with curiosity and suspicion, it eventually captivated the elite, becoming a luxury commodity. Columbus did not immediately recognize its value; Hernán Cortés, arriving in Mexico in 1519, grasped cacao's significance in Aztec society. The Aztecs valued cacao, using it as currency and consuming "xocolatl" during ceremonies. Cortés recognized the economic potential of “bitter water” and began shipping cacao beans back to Spain.

The demand for cacao fueled the expansion of cacao plantations in the Americas, often relying on forced labor and contributing to the exploitation of indigenous populations. The trade in cacao became a major source of wealth for European powers, transforming cities like Amsterdam and London into global trading hubs. Today, chocolate is a global commodity, a testament to cultural exchange, technological innovation, and the desire for indulgence.
