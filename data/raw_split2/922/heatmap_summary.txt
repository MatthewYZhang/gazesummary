**The Mystery of the Missing Megafauna: Late Pleistocene Extinctions**

For millions of years, Earth was home to megafauna, like woolly mammoths and giant sloths, who dominated ecosystems across continents. During the Late Pleistocene epoch, roughly between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, many of these large creatures became extinct. The reasons behind this dramatic loss of megafauna remain a subject of debate among paleontologists and ecologists, with the fossil record indicating these extinctions were not uniform.

Two primary hypotheses are climate change and human impact. The human impact, or “overkill,” hypothesis, argues that megafauna extinctions coincided with the arrival of human populations. According to this hypothesis, skilled hunters systematically hunted large animals to extinction.

Recent research explores other potential factors such as disease and the impact of introduced species in the Late Pleistocene extinctions. In the end, climate change, human impact, disease, and other ecological pressures may have all contributed to the dramatic loss of large animals.
