The development of agriculture marks a crucial turning point in human history. Humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, relying on resources in their immediate environment, to domesticating wild plants and animals. This process, involving the selection of plants with desirable traits and animals for various resources, was gradual and contributed to profound societal changes. The shift enabled stable food supplies supporting larger populations and settled communities. Specialization of labor, accumulation of wealth, and the support of non-agricultural specialists followed, eventually leading to hierarchical social structures and the emergence of states. However, societies also faced drawbacks such as vulnerability to crop failures, spread of diseases, labor demands, and environmental damage. Despite these challenges, agriculture remains a pivotal development, fundamentally shaping human societies and civilizations.
