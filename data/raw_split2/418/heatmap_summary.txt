Rumors, unsubstantiated stories spread from person to person, are ubiquitous and can significantly impact individual behavior and social dynamics. Understanding the psychological factors behind rumor transmission is crucial. One key element is the emotional valence of the information; rumors evoking strong emotions like anxiety or fear are more likely to be shared and believed because emotional arousal increases attention. In times of uncertainty, people seek information to cope, even if unreliable. Rumors are also more likely to be accepted if attributed to a trusted source. This can lead to "source amnesia," where people remember the rumor but forget the source, falsely attributing it to someone credible. Additionally, cognitive biases, like confirmation bias, contribute to the spread of rumors, where individuals selectively attend to information aligning with their pre-existing worldview. Another relevant bias is the "availability heuristic," which leads people to overestimate the likelihood of events that are easily recalled. Combating harmful rumors requires critical thinking, media literacy, and source evaluation. Social media platforms also have a responsibility to monitor and moderate the spread of rumors.
