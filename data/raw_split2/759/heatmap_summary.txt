Zoos, transitioning from entertainment venues, now play a crucial role in wildlife conservation, addressing ethical concerns about keeping animals in captivity by emphasizing species preservation, research, and education. Captive breeding programs are a significant conservation method. These programs aim to safeguard endangered and threatened species from extinction by maintaining and increasing their populations. Zoos carefully manage breeding pairs using genetic data to promote diversity and prevent inbreeding. Animals born in captivity can be reintroduced to their natural environments, strengthening wild populations and aiding ecosystem restoration. However, critics point out that the success of captive breeding programs depends on various factors. The effectiveness hinges on the security and capability of the habitat to support reintroduced populations. Moreover, captive-raised animals may lack crucial survival skills like hunting and predator avoidance, necessitating extensive training and acclimation. Opponents also contend that captive breeding diverts attention from addressing the core issues driving species decline, such as habitat loss and poaching.
