Animal migration is a fascinating phenomenon where animals seasonally move from one place to another. Some migrate for resources like food and water. Arctic terns fly pole-to-pole, while deer search for winter shelter, showing the importance of migration in survival and reproduction. It's still a mystery how they navigate. Many use the sun, stars, and Earth's magnetic field. Birds have special eye cells for detecting magnetic fields, acting as an internal compass. Some animals, like salmon, use smells to find their way back to their home rivers.

Climate change and habitat loss threaten migratory species, so international cooperation is needed for their protection. The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized medicine, but their overuse has led to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a global health crisis. Bacteria evolve to resist antibiotics, making infections harder to treat. A key approach is to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in medicine, agriculture, and animal husbandry, as well as developing alternative therapies and improving infection control in healthcare.
