Impressionism, a transformative art movement of the late 19th century, emerged in France as a reaction to academic painting.  Young Parisian artists like Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro, disillusioned with traditional historical and mythological subjects, sought to break free from the constraints of traditional art education and embraced contemporary landscapes. Édouard Manet's "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe" which was displayed at "Salon des Refusés" was a controversial work. The term "Impressionism" originated from a critic's review of Claude Monet's "Impression, soleil levant".

Getting adequate sleep is essential for maintaining optimal health and performance. Most adults need around 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night, although individual sleep needs may vary. Establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and optimizing the sleep environment can all help to improve sleep quality.
