The Mississippian culture, flourishing in the Mississippi River Valley from roughly 800 to 1600 CE, is known for its complex social organization, sophisticated agriculture, and monumental earthworks. Cahokia, located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois, was the largest and most influential urban center of this culture, offering crucial insights into the dynamics of pre-Columbian societies in North America. Cahokiaâ€™s dramatic rise is attributed to several factors, with a key element being its fertile agricultural land supported by the rich alluvial soils of the Mississippi floodplain. 

The peak of Cahokia occurred between 1050 and 1200 CE. Despite its success, Cahokia experienced a decline beginning in the 13th century with several factors contributing to this decline. Environmental degradation, such as deforestation and soil erosion, may have reduced agricultural productivity and placed stress on resources. While the exact causes of its decline remain debated, the interaction of environmental, social, and political factors played a significant role.
