Coral reefs, known for their biodiversity, depend on symbiotic relationships. A key partnership is between corals and zooxanthellae, algae residing in coral tissue. Corals offer shelter and sunlight access, while zooxanthellae conduct photosynthesis, generating oxygen and nutrients. The symbiotic relationship provides the coral with a large portion of its nutritional needs, while the zooxanthellae also produce the vibrant colors associated with reefs. When stressed, corals may expel zooxanthellae, leading to coral bleaching and potential death. Reefs exhibit other symbiotic relationships like cleaner fish that remove parasites from larger fish. Coral reefs are also home to shrimp and crabs which live within corals' branching structures, receiving protection and food, while invertebrates defend the coral from predators, highlighting the interconnectedness and importance of these relationships in maintaining reef health. Finally, the complexity of these symbiotic relationships makes coral reefs vulnerable to environmental changes, impacting the entire ecosystem.
