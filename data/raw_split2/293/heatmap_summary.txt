The invention of paper in ancient China significantly impacted culture, governance, and the spread of knowledge, marking a pivotal moment in human history. Before paper, materials like oracle bones, bronze inscriptions, bamboo, wooden strips, and silk were used for writing, each with drawbacks such as being cumbersome, bulky, or expensive. Traditional accounts credit Cai Lun of the Han Dynasty with standardizing papermaking around 105 CE, using materials like bark, hemp, old rags, and fishing nets to create a pulp that, when dried, formed a sheet of paper. While his role may not have been as the sole inventor, he played a critical role in refining and promoting the process.

The early techniques of papermaking were closely guarded secrets within China for centuries. Eventually, the superior qualities of paper led to its adoption in neighboring regions, aided by Buddhist monks who sought to copy and spread religious texts. The techniques of papermaking were refined over time with the development of paper sizing to reduce ink absorption and watermarks for authentication. Paper became essential for official documents, currency, maps, artistic expression, and the imperial examinations, fundamentally altering Chinese culture. The knowledge of papermaking later reached the Arab world and Europe, playing a crucial role in revolutions, communication, education, and commerce.
