Jazz, a uniquely American musical art form, evolved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, born in the vibrant, multicultural atmosphere of New Orleans. It initially served as dance music and is characterized by improvisation, syncopation, and a strong rhythmic drive. Early jazz, or Dixieland, featured small ensembles typically comprised of instruments like the trumpet, clarinet, and trombone. Collective improvisation was a hallmark, with each musician contributing spontaneously. Key figures include Buddy Bolden, Jelly Roll Morton, and Louis Armstrong.

The "Jazz Age" of the 1920s saw jazz spreading rapidly across the United States. Swing music emerged as the dominant form. Bebop, a complex and virtuosic style pioneered by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, prioritized improvisation and harmonic experimentation. Fusion also emerged during this period. Throughout its history, jazz has remained a dynamic and evolving art form and the values of improvisation and innovation have remained central to the jazz tradition.
