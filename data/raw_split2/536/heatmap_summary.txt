The development of writing systems represents a significant milestone in human history, enabling the storage of knowledge and facilitating communication across vast distances. One of the oldest known writing systems is cuneiform, originating in Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE. Initially pictographic, cuneiform evolved into a system of wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets, recording information from inventories to historical narratives. Another influential system, hieroglyphics, emerged in ancient Egypt around 3100 BCE and served primarily for religious inscriptions. In contrast to these logographic systems, alphabetic writing systems represented individual sounds. The earliest alphabet emerged in the Levant around 1800 BCE, which was later refined by the Phoenicians and spread throughout the Mediterranean region. The Greek alphabet added vowels, leading to a more complete system, and standardized writing direction. Despite writing's overall benefits, its spread was not always uniform, with initial restriction to elites and the disruption of oral traditions.
