The Columbian Exchange was a significant biological revolution sparked by the encounter between the Old World and the New World, involving the movement of plants, animals, diseases, and people across the Atlantic. A key aspect was the introduction of new crops to both worlds. From the Americas, crops like potatoes, maize, tomatoes, and cassava were brought to Europe, Asia, and Africa, increasing population. Wheat, rice, barley, coffee, apples, and oranges were introduced to the Americas.

The exchange of animals was equally transformative, with Europeans introducing horses, cattle, pigs, and sheep to the Americas, which changed transportation, agriculture, and warfare. The Americas offered animals like turkeys to Europe. The Columbian Exchange also involved the spread of diseases like smallpox, measles, influenza, and typhus to the Americas, which caused devastating epidemics among indigenous populations. In conclusion, the Columbian Exchange was complex, with both positive impacts on food security and dietary diversity and negative consequences such as diseases and the forced migration of people.
