The fall of the Maya civilization, particularly during the Terminal Classic period, remains an enigma with various theories attempting to explain its decline. One prominent explanation attributes the collapse to environmental degradation, including unsustainable agricultural practices like slash-and-burn agriculture that led to soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and reduced crop yields. Deforestation may have also decreased rainfall. Droughts exacerbated by these environmental changes resulted in catastrophic consequences for the Maya society, which was heavily reliant on agriculture and experienced widespread famine, social unrest, and political instability.

The increased warfare between city-states may have further destabilized the region. Moreover, the overextension of the ruling elite may have contributed to the Maya downfall, as the burden of supporting the elite class became unsustainable. The Maya engaged in regional trade networks, exchanging goods such as obsidian, jade, cacao, and textiles. Finally, evidence reveals malnutrition, disease, and violence. The combined effects of environmental degradation, drought, warfare, overpopulation, and political instability likely contributed to the disintegration of Mayan civilization. The Maya culture continued to thrive in the northern Yucatan Peninsula until the colonial period when their autonomy was ultimately lost.
