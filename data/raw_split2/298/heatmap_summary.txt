The transition from aquatic to terrestrial life marked a critical juncture, requiring significant physiological, morphological, and behavioral changes. A major challenge was developing effective terrestrial locomotion methods, given the unique opportunities and obstacles compared to aquatic habitats. Early terrestrial vertebrates like amphibians had a sprawling posture, offering stability but impeding rapid movement, with a "waddling" gait that was energetically costly.

Over time, tetrapods evolved more efficient locomotion, including a shift to a more upright posture with limbs positioned directly beneath the body. This allowed for a parasagittal movement, reducing lateral bending, and increasing stride length. Mammals display diverse locomotor adaptations, including cursorial mammals with elongated limbs and flexible vertebral columns and fossorial mammals with short, powerful limbs for digging. Furthermore, birds use bipedal stance and wing modification for terrestrial mobility and flight, requiring skeletal, muscular, and respiratory changes.

Environmental factors such as habitat and resource availability also influenced terrestrial locomotion evolution. Animals in open grasslands favor cursorial adaptations, while those in dense forests benefit from arboreal adaptations. The evolution of terrestrial locomotion is complex, driven by genetic variation, natural selection, and environmental factors.
