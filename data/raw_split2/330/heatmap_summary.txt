Cooperation is the act of individuals working together, observed across all levels of biological organization. The origins and maintenance of cooperation present a paradox. At the cellular level, cooperation is fundamental to the formation and function of multicellular organisms, where individual cells coordinate activities, sharing resources. Biofilms exemplify this, where bacterial cells encased in a matrix gain advantages.

Cooperation is essential in complex animal societies, like social insects with specialized roles, where kin selection and reciprocal altruism drive cooperation. Reciprocal altruism involves individuals helping each other with the expectation of future returns. The Prisoner's Dilemma illustrates challenges, where defecting appears rational, but mutual cooperation leads to better outcomes. Cooperation is widespread, suggesting mechanisms overcome selfishness, including group selection and punishment.

Human societies exemplify cooperation, underpinned by cultural norms. Understanding cooperation's origins is crucial for addressing challenges like climate change. Studying cooperation across species can foster greater cooperation and a sustainable future.
