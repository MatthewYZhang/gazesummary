Coffee's widespread adoption and transformation into a cultural phenomenon is a relatively recent development, particularly between the 17th and 19th centuries. Initially confined to the Middle East, coffee's appeal quickly spread through European travelers and merchants. Coffeehouses emerged as pivotal social hubs in cities like London, Paris, and Amsterdam, fostering intellectual discourse, political debate, and commercial transactions. Unlike taverns, coffeehouses offered a sober environment, attracting merchants, writers, politicians, and scientists. Coffee production expanded in colonial territories, relying on forced labor and the transatlantic slave trade. Coffee became a staple beverage, supplanting traditional drinks. The social impact of coffeehouses extended beyond exchanges, with governments attempting to regulate them. New brewing methods enhanced coffee consumption, and it became associated with rituals and social practices. The popularity of coffee continued to grow, becoming an indispensable part of daily life.
