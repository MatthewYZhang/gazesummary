The Mississippian culture, flourishing from approximately 800 to 1600 CE, stands out for its remarkable achievements in agriculture, social organization, and monumental architecture. Cahokia, the most prominent center of this culture, was a sprawling urban center that rivaled contemporary European cities in size and complexity. Its rise was linked to its agricultural prowess, with the fertile floodplains and sophisticated farming techniques allowing for surpluses that supported a growing population and specialized labor.

A striking feature of Cahokia was its monumental architecture, including massive earthen mounds like Monks Mound. The construction of these mounds required significant labor and organization, demonstrating advanced engineering and social hierarchy. However, Cahokia experienced a decline in the 13th and 14th centuries, with several factors like environmental degradation and climate change contributing. Today, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site preserves the remnants of this ancient city.

Coral reefs are facing a growing threat: ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, caused primarily by the absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Ocean acidification also affects the symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and microscopic algae called zooxanthellae.
Protecting coral reefs is not only vital for marine ecosystems but also for the millions of people who depend on them for their livelihoods and well-being. By understanding the threat of ocean acidification and taking action to reduce CO2 emissions, we can help ensure the survival of these valuable and irreplaceable ecosystems for future generations.
