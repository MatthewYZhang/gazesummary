Dance is a universal human expression, preceding written language, and it has evolved from early hunter-gatherer societies to modern civilizations, serving as a means of communication, ritual, celebration, and social cohesion. In prehistoric times, dance emerged in response to natural rhythms and survival needs, with cave paintings depicting ritualistic movements connected to hunting, fertility, and propitiation of spirits. These communal and improvisational dances were accompanied by percussion instruments and imitated animal behavior, emphasizing strength, agility, and the cyclical nature of life.
As societies transitioned to settled agricultural communities, dance became more formalized and integrated into religious ceremonies in ancient civilizations like Egypt, Greece, and Rome. The Middle Ages in Europe saw a shift in the role of dance influenced by Christianity, where folk dances persisted, and the Renaissance brought a revival of classical art, leading to ballet with its emphasis on grace and technical virtuosity. The evolution of dance reflects the complexities and diversity of the modern world.
