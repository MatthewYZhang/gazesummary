Islands, both oceanic and land-bridge, offer natural laboratories for evolution and species interactions. The distribution of life on islands varies based on size, isolation, and habitat diversity. Island ecosystems often have impoverished biodiversity compared to mainland areas. This phenomenon, known as the "island effect," arises from limited immigration, higher extinction rates, and simplified food webs. Geographic isolation acts as a dispersal barrier, while smaller populations are more vulnerable to extinction. Islands exhibit high levels of endemism, leading to unique evolutionary pressures and rapid speciation. Island size plays a critical role in determining species richness.

The geological timescale chronologically represents Earth's history, dividing it based on rock layers and geological events. It is a tool for understanding the timing of past events. It is divided into eons, eras, and periods. The boundaries between different units of the timescale are often defined by significant geological or biological events. The timescale is essential for understanding Earth's history and the evolution of life and is crucial for understanding the present and predicting future changes.
