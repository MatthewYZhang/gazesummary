Artificial light at night (ALAN) introduced by electric lighting in the 19th century has had profound and often detrimental effects on a wide range of wildlife, impacting their behavior, physiology, and ecology. Nocturnal animals rely on darkness for hunting, foraging, and mating, but artificial light can interfere with these activities, making it difficult for predators to find prey and for prey to avoid predators. Streetlights can reduce the hunting success of nocturnal predators like owls, while simultaneously increasing the vulnerability of their prey. Similarly, the mating rituals of many insects, amphibians, and birds are triggered by specific light cues, which can be disrupted by ALAN, leading to decreased reproductive success. To mitigate the impacts of ALAN, conservation efforts include light pollution ordinances and shielded light fixtures. LED lighting and new lighting technologies that emit wavelengths of light that are less disruptive to wildlife are also playing a role. By implementing effective light pollution policies, promoting the use of wildlife-friendly lighting technologies, and raising public awareness, we can protect the natural rhythms of life.
