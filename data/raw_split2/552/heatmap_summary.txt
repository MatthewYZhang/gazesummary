Before printing, knowledge was spread by laborious hand-copying by scribes, which was time-consuming and prone to errors, limiting access to the wealthy and powerful. Printing, a revolutionary technological advancement, dramatically altered this landscape, ushering in an era of unprecedented access to information. The earliest forms of printing emerged in Asia, notably in China, with woodblock printing as early as the 7th century. This involved carving an entire page of text onto a wooden block, inking the surface, and then pressing it onto paper. This was effective for reproducing Buddhist scriptures, but it was cumbersome and required a separate block for each page. The invention of movable type in the 11th century by Bi Sheng in China used individual characters made from baked clay, but it was not widely adopted due to the complexity of the Chinese writing system. Over the centuries, printing technology has continued to evolve, with the development of increasingly sophisticated presses, typesetting machines, and digital printing methods. From the early woodblock prints of Asia to the high-speed inkjet printers of today, the evolution of printing technology has played a critical role in shaping human civilization, enabling the spread of knowledge, ideas, and information on an unprecedented scale.
