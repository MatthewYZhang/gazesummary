Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a pervasive aspect of modern life that has significant ecological and environmental consequences. ALAN disrupts ingrained behaviors in wildlife, leading to ecological imbalances and disrupting natural light cycles that govern biological processes. Nocturnal insects are drawn to artificial lights, leading to exhaustion and increased vulnerability to predation. Migrating birds are disoriented by artificial lights, causing collisions with buildings, resulting in significant mortality rates. Marine ecosystems are also vulnerable to ALAN, especially for sea turtles. Coastal lighting interferes with nesting, disorienting hatchlings. Mitigation strategies are imperative to reduce ALAN's effects, like utilizing smart lighting technologies and shielded light fixtures. Public awareness and education are also essential for addressing the issue of ALAN. Educating communities can encourage responsible lighting practices. It is crucial to adopt responsible lighting practices to minimize ALAN's negative impacts.
