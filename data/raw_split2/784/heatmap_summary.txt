The Cambrian Explosion, occurring approximately 541 to 485.4 million years ago, marks a pivotal period in Earth's history. It followed the Ediacaran period, which saw the emergence of early multicellular organisms. In the Cambrian, there was a dramatic burst of evolutionary innovation. During this short period, most major animal phyla appeared in the fossil record, which has puzzled scientists for centuries.

Prior to this, life was largely microbial. However, the Cambrian Explosion marked a shift to biological complexity, with fossils showing creatures with exoskeletons and segmented bodies. A prominent hypothesis of its cause centers on rising oxygen levels, providing metabolic fuel for larger organisms. These oxygen levels could have played a key role in the formation of collagen. Another contributing factor is the evolution of Hox genes, which control the body plan of animals. Finally, ecological interactions, such as the evolution of predation, spurred an arms race, leading to defensive structures and sensory systems. This period is marked by the rapid pace of evolutionary change. While several hypotheses attempt to explain it, the Cambrian Explosion remains a topic of intense research and debate.
