The symphony, a cornerstone of Western classical music, has evolved significantly over centuries, with its form, instrumentation, and emotional expression undergoing transformations. Unlike popular songs today, early symphonies were unique performances, reflecting the specific musicians and the composer's mood. Before standardized scores, symphonies were more akin to improvisations guided by a loose framework, with each performance holding the potential for variations and subtle nuances. The term "symphony" initially referred to any instrumental ensemble piece, but the symphonic form we recognize today began to crystallize in the mid-18th century thanks to composers like Joseph Haydn. Haydn's symphonies, with their clear structure and graceful melodies, established the template for the Classical symphony. As the 18th century progressed, symphonies gradually moved into the public sphere. By the early 19th century, composers began to express breadth, depth and artistry within the symphonic form. Composers today continue to push the boundaries of what a symphony can be.
