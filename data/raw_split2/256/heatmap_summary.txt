The history of civilization is intertwined with the evolution of trade routes, facilitating the exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies. The Silk Road, a network connecting East Asia and the Mediterranean, played a vital role in exchanging silk, spices, tea, and porcelain from the East for horses, wool, gold, and silver from the West. It also facilitated the spread of Buddhism and Christianity. Cities like Samarkand and Dunhuang thrived along the Silk Road. The trans-Saharan routes linked sub-Saharan Africa with the Mediterranean and the Middle East, exchanging gold, salt, slaves, and kola nuts for textiles and horses. Empires like Ghana, Mali, and Songhai rose due to their control over key trading centers. These ancient trade routes shaped civilizations and contributed to political, economic, and social changes. Disruptions of these established trade networks could lead to political instability and social unrest, as traditional power structures were challenged and new economic inequalities arose.
