The history of human civilization is intertwined with the development of trade networks. These networks have shaped cultures, driven economic growth, and influenced political landscapes. One of the earliest and most influential trade networks was the Silk Road, a sprawling network that connected the East and West. Originating in China during the Han Dynasty, the Silk Road facilitated the exchange of silk, spices, tea, porcelain, and other valuable goods from the East to the Roman Empire and beyond. In return, the West provided precious metals, textiles, and glass. The Silk Road wasn't a single road but rather a web of interconnected routes traversing deserts, mountains, and seas. The Maya, Aztec, and Inca empires established extensive trade routes that facilitated the exchange of goods, ideas, and cultural practices. The Aztecs controlled a vast trade network that stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Ocean, collecting tribute and facilitating trade through their capital. The arrival of Europeans in the Americas drastically altered indigenous trade networks, prioritizing the extraction of resources and the exploitation of indigenous labor.
