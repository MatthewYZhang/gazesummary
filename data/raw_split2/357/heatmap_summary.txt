For centuries, the seasonal disappearance and reappearance of birds has sparked curiosity. Modern science has revealed the complex reality of bird migration, a regular, seasonal movement between breeding and non-breeding areas driven by factors like food availability and breeding opportunities. Migratory behavior can vary geographically within a single species. Understanding how birds navigate is a major research focus. Birds use the Earth's magnetic field, the sun's position, and visual landmarks to orient themselves. Some rely on innate programming, while others learn from experienced adults. Despite the risks of exhaustion, starvation, and habitat loss, migration persists due to the benefits of abundant food and favorable breeding conditions. Modern technology has revolutionized the study of bird migration. Researchers use GPS trackers to track individual birds and isotope analysis to reveal a bird's origin and movements.
