Coffee's journey from Ethiopian highlands to a global commodity involves trade, colonialism, and evolving social practices. Coffee's origins trace back to Ethiopia, where the *Coffea arabica* plant grew wild, and coffee cultivation later spread to Yemen. Coffee houses emerged in the Middle East in the 15th and 16th centuries as social and intellectual hubs.

European travelers introduced coffee to Europe, where coffee houses became popular, fostering trade and the Enlightenment. Increased demand led to coffee plantations in colonial territories, such as Indonesia, the Caribbean, and South America, impacting their social and economic structures. Coffee's impact extends to social customs, artistic expression, and intellectual discourse. Coffee's consumption rituals reflect the beverage's cultural significance. The act of enjoying a cup of coffee can be an opportunity to reflect on the long and complex journey of this ubiquitous beverage and its impact on the world.
