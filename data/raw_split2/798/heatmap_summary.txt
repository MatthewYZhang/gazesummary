The Great Smog of London was one of the worst environmental disasters in London's history. This severe air pollution episode paralyzed the city in December 1952 for several days, causing thousands of deaths. London had a long history of air pollution due to the reliance on coal for heating and industrial processes. The Great Smog of 1952 was far more severe than anything the city had previously experienced. The weather conditions and lack of wind contributed to the trapping of pollutants. Visibility was drastically reduced and people struggled to breathe, with hospitals being overwhelmed with patients suffering from respiratory problems. The severity of the smog was initially downplayed. The aftermath was devastating with thousands of deaths. The most significant piece of legislation was the Clean Air Act of 1956, which aimed to reduce smoke emissions. The Great Smog of London remains a stark reminder of the dangers of air pollution.
