Before the printing press, knowledge was manually transcribed by monks and scholars for the elite, limiting accessibility. Literacy rates were low and social hierarchies were reinforced. In 1440, Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable type printing press, revolutionizing communication. This device used reusable metal type to produce multiple identical copies, marking a shift from manuscript to print culture. Gutenberg's press decreased the cost of book production, making information more accessible. The Gutenberg Bible, completed around 1455, is considered the first major book printed using movable type. The increased availability of books spurred a rise in literacy rates across Europe, empowering people to engage with new ideas. The printing press facilitated the rapid dissemination of knowledge, contributing to the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution. Despite its transformative impact, the printing press faced resistance and censorship, but its genie could not be easily contained.
