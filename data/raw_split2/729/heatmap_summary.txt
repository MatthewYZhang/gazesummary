Jazz, a distinctly American art form, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily within African American communities in New Orleans, as a fusion of African and European musical traditions, utilizing syncopation, improvisation, and polyrhythms. Early jazz drew heavily from spirituals, work songs, ragtime, and brass band music. New Orleans' environment, with its diverse population, history as a port, and vibrant music scene, created a fertile ground for innovation. Storyville district provided venues for early jazz pioneers such as Buddy Bolden to shape the genre.

Bolden is considered the first important figure in jazz, known for his innovative approach to improvisation. As jazz spread, it evolved into various styles, including Dixieland jazz, characterized by collective improvisation, and the swing era, marked by larger ensembles and smoother sounds. The post-World War II era witnessed the development of bebop, emphasizing fast tempos and intricate harmonies. Since then, Jazz has continued to evolve and diversify, with styles like cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, free jazz, and fusion. Despite its evolution, it continues to be defined by its core principles: improvisation, swing, and a connection to the African American experience.
