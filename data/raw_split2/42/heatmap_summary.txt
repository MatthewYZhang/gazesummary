The Cambrian explosion, a pivotal period in Earth's history roughly 541 to 485.4 million years ago, marks a rapid diversification of life. Prior to this, life consisted of simple, single-celled organisms. Within a short time, a vast array of complex organisms and body plans emerged to fill vacant ecological niches. The fossil record offers compelling evidence, revealing diverse creatures from the Cambrian period, including fossils from British Columbia, Canada, which showcase an astonishing variety of arthropods, chordates, and other enigmatic life forms with eyes, appendages, and exoskeletons, indicating a significant leap in evolutionary complexity. Several hypotheses seek to explain the Cambrian explosion. One prominent theory is about rising oxygen levels that fueled larger, more active creatures, and facilitated the formation of ozone, allowing them to colonize shallower waters. The emergence of predators led to the evolution of defensive adaptations and spurred diversification, impacting how organisms accessed resources and avoided predation. It set the stage for complex life.
