Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a major crisis due to the widespread and inappropriate use of antibiotics, leading to bacteria evolving the ability to survive exposure to previously effective drugs. This resistance arises through mechanisms like genetic mutations and changes in bacterial structure. The emergence of resistance is a natural consequence of evolution where susceptible bacteria are killed by antibiotics, allowing resistant bacteria to survive and multiply. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics, particularly in human medicine and agriculture, drive this resistance, contributing to the rise of "superbugs." 

Infections caused by resistant bacteria are difficult and expensive to treat, with consequences ranging from prolonged illness and disability to death, and the rise of resistance poses a major threat to public health. Strategies to address this challenge include reducing antibiotic use through appropriate prescribing practices, improving infection control, and educating the public. Developing new antibiotics and international collaboration are also essential in the fight against antibiotic resistance to protect public health.
