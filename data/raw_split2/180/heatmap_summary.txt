Bird migration is a seasonal phenomenon of birds moving between breeding and non-breeding areas. The evolution of migration is considered to be driven by resource availability and the avoidance of harsh environmental conditions, especially in temperate and arctic regions where insect populations explode during the summer and dwindle as winter approaches. Migration to warmer climates allows for survival and reproduction. One theory posits that migration began as short-distance movements that gradually extended, while another suggests it evolved from a nomadic lifestyle following shifting resources. Regardless, natural selection has favored adaptations for long-distance flight, navigation, and energy storage. The navigational abilities of migratory birds are truly remarkable, and they use cues such as the Earth's magnetic field, the position of the sun and stars, polarized light, and olfactory cues. Some birds are born with a sense of direction, while others learn routes from experienced adults. Birds preparing for migration undergo significant physiological changes such as increased fat storage, muscle development, and hormonal changes. These changes allow them to fly for extended periods, conserve energy, and resist disease. The longest non-stop migration on record is that of the Bar-tailed Godwit, which flies over 7,000 miles from Alaska to New Zealand without landing.
