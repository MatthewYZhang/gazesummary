E-commerce has evolved into a dominant force, reshaping retail, distribution, and manufacturing through advancements in technology and shifting consumer preferences. The early days of e-commerce were marked by the emergence of online marketplaces and virtual storefronts, which saw exponential growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to secure online payment systems and sophisticated logistics networks. Companies like Amazon and eBay pioneered new business models, leveraging technology to streamline supply chains and personalize customer experiences. This shift has proven irresistible to consumers.

By the mid-2000s, e-commerce transitioned from a niche market to a mainstream phenomenon, with retailers recognizing the importance of establishing an online presence. Mobile commerce further accelerated this trend, with social media platforms also emerging as powerful channels for transactions. Despite its success, e-commerce faces challenges. These include the struggles of traditional retailers, concerns about labor practices, and the environmental impact of packaging and shipping. Antitrust concerns have also arisen due to the concentration of power in the hands of dominant platforms. E-commerce continues to evolve with the incorporation of technologies like AI and blockchain, blurring the lines between online and offline shopping through omnichannel commerce.
