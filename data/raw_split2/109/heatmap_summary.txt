Coral reefs, which are vibrant and biodiverse ecosystems often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," support an estimated 25% of all marine life. These reefs are built by tiny animals called coral polyps that live in a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae reside within the coral tissue, providing the coral with food through photosynthesis, and the coral offers the algae protection and essential nutrients, a partnership crucial for their survival. This balance is increasingly threatened by coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel zooxanthellae in response to environmental stressors like elevated water temperatures, ocean acidification, pollution, and increased sedimentation. When the algae are gone, the coral loses its primary food source and its vibrant color, appearing pale or white. Rising ocean temperatures due to climate change, water temperature increases can trigger bleaching events. Pollution and ocean acidification also pose a threat. Efforts to protect coral reefs include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water quality, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.
