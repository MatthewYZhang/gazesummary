The Knights Templar, a medieval military order, emerged during the Crusades in the 12th century, founded in 1119 to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. Sanctioned by the Catholic Church in 1129, the Order quickly became powerful. They amassed immense wealth through land ownership, agricultural production, and banking, with banking operations becoming renowned.

Their military prowess was crucial in defending Crusader states, serving as shock troops in battles. Fortified commanderies, like Château Pèlerin, acted as strategic strongholds. With the fall of Acre in 1291, the Templars' purpose diminished, leading to accusations of heresy. King Philip IV of France, in debt to the Templars, launched an attack in 1307, arresting them on charges of heresy. The trials were politically motivated, and despite some confessions under duress, many maintained innocence. Philip IV pressured Pope Clement V to dissolve the Order, which happened in 1312.

The Templars' assets were supposed to be transferred to other religious orders, but Philip IV seized much of the wealth. Some Templars were imprisoned, others executed, including Grand Master Jacques de Molay, who was burned at the stake. The downfall of the Knights Templar remains debated, with their wealth making them targets.

Recent research reveals that bilingualism offers significant cognitive advantages throughout life, impacting executive functions and delaying cognitive decline. Bilingual individuals switch between languages frequently, which exercises executive functions. Studies show bilinguals exhibit increased gray matter density in brain regions associated with executive control. This suggests that managing two languages leads to structural changes in the brain. Bilingualism also contributes to cognitive reserve, delaying dementia symptoms. It enhances brain efficiency and resilience, with benefits extending beyond childhood. However, not all studies have found consistent evidence of cognitive advantages, and factors like language proficiency can influence the effects. Bilingualism is a cognitive asset, offering benefits throughout the lifespan.
