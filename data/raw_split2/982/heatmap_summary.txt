Honeybees exhibit a complex social structure with a fascinating hierarchy that ensures the colony's survival. This system has evolved over time, shaped by environmental pressures and cooperative living. At the apex of the society is the queen, the sole reproductive female responsible for laying eggs. Her dominance is maintained by pheromones, which influence other bees and prevent worker bees from reproducing. The queen is constantly attended by worker bees who provide care. Worker bees, all of whom are sterile females, perform essential tasks, and their roles change as they age, including nurse bees, cleaning cells, building honeycomb, guarding the hive entrance, and foraging for nectar, pollen, and water. Male bees, known as drones, occupy the lowest social rung, with the sole purpose of mating with the queen. As environmental pressures continue to change, honeybee colonies will likely adapt and evolve in response.
