Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, holds a profound mystery regarding the rise and fall of its Polynesian civilization. Archaeological evidence suggests that the island was first settled around 1200 AD by Polynesian seafarers, who brought with them a rich cultural heritage and the knowledge of agriculture and seafaring. The early Rapa Nui society thrived on the island's resources, cultivating crops and relying on fishing and raising chickens. The island was divided into clans, each with its own territory and leaders, and the most notable feature of this period was the construction of the Moai. The prosperity of the Rapa Nui civilization was not sustainable, however, as the population continued to grow, leading to deforestation. The inhabitants cleared forests to create agricultural land, build canoes, and transport the Moai, which had devastating consequences. Deforestation had played a significant role in the collapse of Easter Island society. Today, the island is a Chilean territory, and its inhabitants are working to preserve their cultural heritage and protect the island's fragile environment.
