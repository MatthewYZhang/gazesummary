The evolution of communication signals in animal behavior is crucial to understanding animal interactions. Animals use a wide range of signals for mate attraction, predator avoidance, defense, and social cohesion. The handicap principle explains that reliable signals are costly and difficult to fake. A peacock's tail, energetically expensive to maintain, demonstrates the male's superior genes, indicating quality. Sensory exploitation is an important aspect, where signals evolve by exploiting sensory biases of receivers.

Environmental factors also shape communication signals as some urban songbirds sing at higher frequencies due to traffic noise. Dishonest signals can provide temporary advantages, leading to an "arms race" between signalers and receivers. Fireflies use bioluminescent flashes, but some females mimic other species to lure and eat males. Marine animal communication relies on acoustic signals because sound travels well underwater, with whales using complex vocalizations. The study of animal communication can provide a deeper understanding of the natural world.
