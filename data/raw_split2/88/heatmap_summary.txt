Cahokia, located in the Mississippi River floodplains near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, flourished from around 1050 to 1350 CE. It stands as a significant example of social organization, agricultural innovation, and monumental construction of the Mississippian culture. The city's emergence coincided with agricultural development, notably the adoption of maize agriculture along with beans and squash, which stabilized the food supply. This surplus supported a growing population and enabled the specialization of labor. Cahokia's complex social hierarchies and impressive public works, including monumental earthworks such as the over 120 earthen mounds highlight the engineering skills of the Cahokian people. These served as platforms for residences, ceremonial spaces, and burial sites. The city's central precinct, surrounded by a wooden palisade, suggests a structured society. The eventual decline is likely attributed to environmental stress, including deforestation and climate change impacting agricultural production, leading to famine and the abandonment of the city. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
