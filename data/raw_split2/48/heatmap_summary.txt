The fashion industry has undergone a significant transformation with the rise of "fast fashion," involving the rapid production of inexpensive clothing by mass-market retailers, often mimicking high-fashion designs. This phenomenon has democratized fashion by making trendy styles accessible to a wider consumer base, while also raising ethical and environmental concerns.

Before the late 20th century, fashion houses dictated seasonal styles, and clothing production followed a slower pace. However, the late 1990s and early 2000s saw the emergence of retailers quickly translating runway trends into affordable everyday wear, with companies like Zara, H&M, and Forever 21 pioneering this model. The constant turnover fuels a culture of consumerism, where clothing is often viewed as disposable. The use of synthetic fabrics and harmful dyes in clothing production contributes to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

In response to these concerns, a growing movement is advocating for sustainable and ethical fashion practices, including promoting fair labor standards, using eco-friendly materials, and reducing waste.
