Organisms in nature often develop intricate relationships for survival, exemplified by Mycorrhizal fungi, where each species becomes reliant on the other. The relationship between yucca plants and yucca moths is a prime example of coevolution. Yucca plants produce large, white, and fragrant flowers, which contain the plant's reproductive organs, attracting yucca moths. Yucca moths actively pollinate the yucca flowers by collecting pollen from one flower and depositing it on the stigma of another, ensuring fertilization. In return, female moths deposit their eggs within the flower's ovary, where the moth larvae hatch and feed on a subset of the seeds. The system works because yucca plants selectively abort flowers that receive too many eggs or too little pollination, and the moth larvae are dependent on the yucca seeds.

The yucca plant benefits from the reliable pollination services, and the moth benefits from a secure food source, forming an interdependent relationship. This highlights the power and fragility of coevolution. Physical weathering involves the disintegration of rocks into smaller pieces, driven by physical forces. Freeze-thaw action is one mechanism where water seeps into cracks, expands when frozen, and widens the cracks.
