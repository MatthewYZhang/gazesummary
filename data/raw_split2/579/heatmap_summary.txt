Coffee cultivation in the Americas began after it was consumed as a stimulating beverage in the Arabian Peninsula and spread to Europe. Its success in Europe drove the demand for coffee beans, and the climate in the Americas was ideal for cultivation. The Dutch initially introduced coffee to the Americas, but the French in Martinique propelled its spread to other Caribbean islands, Central America, and South America. Brazil became the dominant coffee producer. The tropical climates and fertile soils contributed to its success, as did the availability of cheap labor. Despite challenges like diseases, coffee cultivation expanded with new technologies and crop diversification. Coffee cultivation transformed the Americas, creating new settlements and contributing to social inequalities, becoming a major export commodity. Today, it continues to be a significant part of the cultural and economic landscape.
