The late Pleistocene epoch was marked by a significant megafauna extinction event, disproportionately affecting mammals but also impacting large birds and reptiles. The two primary hypotheses explaining this event are climate change and human overhunting. The climate change hypothesis suggests that rapid shifts in temperature and vegetation during the transition from glacial to interglacial periods stressed megafauna populations, while the human overhunting hypothesis posits that the arrival and proliferation of humans coincided with these extinctions.

Sleep is a complex and active process vital for maintaining optimal cognitive function. It plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, learning, and overall brain health. During sleep, the brain replays and strengthens newly acquired memories, transferring them from short-term to long-term storage, which primarily occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS). Adequate sleep enhances the ability to acquire new information and skills. Sleep also is essential for clearing out metabolic waste products that accumulate during wakefulness. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to various negative health outcomes.
