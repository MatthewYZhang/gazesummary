The Hopewell culture, a network of Amerindian peoples, emerged around 2,200 years ago in the Midwestern United States, sharing religious beliefs, burial practices, and trade networks. They are known for their elaborate burial mounds and earthworks, frequently constructed with geometric shapes aligned to astronomical events. These constructions implied significant social organization and labor. The Newark Earthworks in Ohio, an interconnected complex covering miles, displayed meticulous alignment with the lunar cycle. The Hopewell artisans created intricate pottery, effigy pipes, and copper ornaments, reflecting an understanding of aesthetics and connection to nature, with effigy pipes used in ceremonial rituals. They cultivated local plants, taking advantage of fertile soils deposited by rivers, supplementing their diet with wild plants and animals. The Hopewell culture began to decline around A.D. 400, with construction of earthworks and burial rituals becoming less common. Environmental change, social unrest, and new cultural practices may have contributed to this decline.
