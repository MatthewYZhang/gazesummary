Impressionism, a radical art movement from late 19th-century France, transformed Western art by embracing modern life and capturing subjective experiences of light and color. Several factors contributed to its emergence including industrialization and urbanization of Paris, the advent of photography, and the availability of pre-mixed paints which enabled artists to paint outdoors.  The invention of photography presented the artists an artistic opportunity to explore new artistic possibilities. Rapid industrialization and urbanization transformed Paris, creating a dynamic and visually stimulating environment. Key figures such as Monet, Degas, Renoir, and Pissarro employed loose strokes and vibrant colors in everyday scenes.  Despite initial criticism and lack of skill, the Impressionists continued to exhibit and eventually gained recognition with support from collectors and critics. Their emphasis on subjective experience and color paved the way for later art movements.
