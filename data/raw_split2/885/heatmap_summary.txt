Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, became the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, showcasing early urbanism and societal change. It emerged around AD 600, with rapid growth between AD 1050 and 1200, reaching a population of 10,000 to 20,000, exceeding many European cities. This growth was fueled by agricultural surpluses, including maize, beans, and squash, supported by new maize varieties and intensive farming.

The city featured monumental architecture, dominated by earthen mounds like Monks Mound. These mounds served as platforms for temples and elite residences, indicating a hierarchical social organization. Cahokia also included plazas, residential areas, and a woodhenge for astronomical observations.

Cahokia's political and social structure likely centered on a chiefdom system with powerful leaders. Social stratification is evidenced by burial practices with elaborate grave goods and specialized craft production. The city's influence extended throughout the Mississippi River Valley, indicating its role as a major trade and cultural exchange center, facilitated by its strategic location.

However, Cahokia declined by the 14th century due to factors such as environmental degradation, resource depletion, social unrest, and climate change. Despite its decline, Cahokia remains an example of pre-Columbian urbanism, demonstrating the ingenuity of the Mississippian culture.
