Mycorrhizae, symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, play a crucial role in forest ecosystems by benefiting both organisms: the plant receives enhanced access to nutrients and water, while the fungus obtains carbohydrates. There are two primary types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae, which form a sheath around the plant root and create the Hartig net, and endomycorrhizae, which penetrate directly into the root cells forming arbuscules where nutrient exchange occurs. These fungi enhance nutrient uptake, particularly of phosphorus, nitrogen, and micronutrients, by extending hyphae far beyond the root system. They also improve water uptake. Mycorrhizae provide plants with protection against pathogens and harsh environmental conditions, enhance plant tolerance to heavy metals, and facilitate communication between plants. Recent research has focused on their role in carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. Understanding how human activities affect mycorrhizae is crucial for sustainable forest management.
