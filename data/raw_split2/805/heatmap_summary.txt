The disappearance of the Roanoke Colony, established in 1587, remains one of American history's most perplexing mysteries. The initial English expedition, led by Sir Walter Raleigh, aimed to establish a permanent settlement in North America. The first attempt was unsuccessful, and Raleigh organized a second expedition, led by Governor John White, with the intention of creating a self-sustaining agricultural community. White had to return to England for supplies.

When White returned in 1590, he found the colony deserted and only the word "CROATOAN" carved into a post and the letters "CRO" on a tree. White interpreted that to mean that the colonists relocated to Croatoan Island. White was unable to search Croatoan Island, and the fate of the Roanoke colonists remained a mystery. One theory suggests the colonists were assimilated into the Croatoan tribe, while another points to conflict with Native American tribes.
