The emergence and subsequent dominance of reality television marks a significant shift in broadcast entertainment, fundamentally altering audience expectations and production practices. The conventional division in television history now includes the era before reality TV.

Despite its meteoric rise, some critics predicted that reality television would be a fleeting trend, citing low production values, reliance on sensationalism, and perceived lack of artistic merit. However, the critics failed to appreciate the convergence of several crucial factors that fueled the enduring popularity of reality television. These factors included the increasing fragmentation of the television audience, the rise of social media, and the ability to engage with shows in real-time through platforms like Twitter and Facebook. By the early 2000s, reality television had firmly established itself as a dominant force in the television industry, with networks investing heavily in the development of new formats. Although some traditional television series maintained popularity, the sheer volume of reality shows on television grew exponentially. Reality television has become a permanent fixture of popular culture and still remains highly popular today.
