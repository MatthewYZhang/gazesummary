The key driver of change was a complex interplay of agricultural innovation, social organization, and religious ideology, leading to the unprecedented rise of Cahokia, a major urban center near present-day St. Louis, Missouri. Archaeological investigations have provided significant insights into the development of Cahokia. The adoption of a new, highly productive variety of maize, coupled with improvements in agricultural techniques led to a significant surplus of food.
