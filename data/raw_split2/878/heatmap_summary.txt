Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a significant threat to wildlife, disrupting natural light cycles and altering behaviors, which impacts survival and reproduction. One profound effect is on animal navigation, where nocturnal animals like migratory birds and sea turtles get disoriented by artificial lights. Migratory birds collide with brightly lit buildings, and sea turtles are drawn inland, leading to predation or dehydration. ALAN also affects foraging behavior, influencing predator-prey relationships and causing unnatural dependencies. Reproduction is significantly affected, disrupting breeding cycles and impacting clutch sizes and offspring survival, particularly for amphibians that rely on darkness for courtship. Mitigation strategies include using shielded light fixtures, lowering light intensity, and implementing lighting curfews. Additionally, "dark sky" initiatives and public education help reduce light pollution, but challenges remain as urbanization and demand for artificial light increase. Balancing human needs with ecological requirements through thoughtful lighting strategies is crucial.
