Bird migration involves seasonal movements between breeding and non-breeding areas. These journeys require complex navigational skills, endurance, and physiological adaptations. Birds navigate vast distances using celestial cues like the stars and the Earth's magnetic field. Experiments show they use an internal magnetic compass and can compensate for changes in the magnetic field. Some birds rely on landmarks, while others learn migration routes from parents.

The physiological demands are immense, requiring significant energy reserves. Birds undergo intense feeding to build up substantial fat stores. During migration, they experience increased metabolic rates and altered sleep patterns, with some even shutting down half their brain during flight. Despite growing understanding, many questions remain about how birds integrate navigational cues and adapt to changing conditions. Human activities, particularly habitat loss and climate change, pose significant threats. Artificial light at night can disorient birds, leading to collisions. Conservation efforts are crucial, requiring international cooperation and coordinated efforts to protect migratory birds and their habitats. Bird migration remains a remarkable feat, highlighting the interconnectedness of ecosystems.
