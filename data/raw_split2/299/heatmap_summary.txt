The evolution of artificial light began with humans relying on daylight and fire for illumination after sunset. Early forms of artificial light, like torches and oil lamps, were revolutionary but crude. The development of the candle marked a significant step forward, providing a cleaner and brighter light source. Gas lighting, using coal gas piped into homes and businesses, offered a much brighter and more consistent light than candles or oil lamps. The invention of the incandescent light bulb by Thomas Edison in 1879 ushered in a new era of artificial light, transforming the way people lived and worked. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have emerged as the dominant lighting technology, replacing other lighting technologies in homes, businesses, and public spaces. As lighting technology continues to advance, it promises to further enhance our lives, improve energy efficiency, and create new possibilities for illumination.
