The bicycle, a simple invention, has profoundly impacted society, technology, and culture since the 19th century. The evolution of the bicycle reflects broader societal changes and technological advancements, from a novelty item to a mode of transportation and a symbol of sustainability. The significant breakthrough came with the invention of the pedal-operated bicycle in the 1860s, attributed to Pierre Michaux and his son Ernest in France. Their "boneshaker" gained popularity despite its shortcomings. The "boneshaker" paved the way for the "high-wheeler" or "penny-farthing" in the 1870s. In recent decades, growing concerns about environmental sustainability, traffic congestion, and public health, the bicycle continues to offer a simple yet powerful solution for promoting individual well-being and environmental sustainability.
