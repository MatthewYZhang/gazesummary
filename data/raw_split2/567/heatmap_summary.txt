Social media has reshaped political discourse, impacting citizen engagement and campaign conduct. A significant advantage is its accessibility, allowing individuals to voice opinions and share information, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and increasing participation, especially among younger demographics. However, this ease of sharing can lead to less critical thinking and inflammatory content, amplifying sensationalism and polarization. Algorithms personalize content feeds, creating filter bubbles where users are only exposed to confirming information. Political campaigns use social media for voter mobilization, but this can also involve manipulative tactics like spreading misinformation and targeted propaganda. The impact of social media on political discourse is complex, with both opportunities and challenges needing mitigation to promote informed engagement and integrity. Anonymity can embolden bad actors to spread misinformation, engage in personal attacks, and harass political opponents without fear of accountability. This can contribute to a decline in civility and an erosion of trust in the political process. Sophisticated data analytics raise ethical concerns about privacy and manipulation. Safeguarding the integrity of democratic processes is essential.
