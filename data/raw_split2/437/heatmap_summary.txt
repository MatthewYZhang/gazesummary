For many years, bilingualism was considered a cognitive handicap, potentially confusing children, but modern research reveals cognitive benefits associated with speaking more than one language, including impacts on cognitive control, attention, and potentially delaying age-related cognitive decline.  One significant benefit is enhanced cognitive control, which refers to the brain's ability to manage and regulate thoughts and actions. Bilingual individuals develop a stronger cognitive control because they manage and select between two linguistic systems, translating to improved performance on tasks that require attention and focus. Bilingualism has been linked to improved attentional abilities, with bilingual children often outperforming monolingual children on tasks that require sustained and selective attention. Some research indicates that bilingualism may even provide a buffer against age-related cognitive decline. Moreover, the cognitive advantages of bilingualism may depend on factors such as the age of acquisition and proficiency level. Further research is needed to clarify the specific mechanisms through which bilingualism shapes the brain and enhances cognitive abilities.
