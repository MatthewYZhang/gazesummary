The passenger pigeon, once the most abundant bird in North America, darkened the sky with vast flocks. John James Audubon witnessed a flock that took three days to pass, numbering over one billion birds, however this abundance hid a fatal vulnerability to relying on massive flocks for breeding and survival. These birds went extinct in 1914, highlighting the devastating impact of human activities on wildlife.

They thrived in deciduous forests, feeding on beechnuts, acorns, and seeds, constantly searching for abundant food sources. Their lifestyle was nomadic, and their huge gatherings, known as "pigeon cities," were crucial for reproduction, offering protection and synchronized breeding.

The decline began in the 19th century with relentless hunting and habitat destruction. The birds were easily harvested for meat, leading to commercial hunters targeting them. The extinction of the passenger pigeon serves as a reminder of the human impact on wildlife, and the importance of conservation.
