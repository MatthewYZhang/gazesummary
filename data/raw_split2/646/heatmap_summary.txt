The late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen a resurgence of interest in urban gardening. The movement is transforming how city dwellers interact with their food and environment, fueled by concerns for the environment, economic factors, and a desire to connect with nature. Conventional agriculture contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss through industrial farming practices, heavy pesticide use, and long-distance transportation. Urban gardens offer a more sustainable alternative. By growing food locally, they reduce transportation costs, minimize pesticide use, and promote biodiversity by creating habitats for pollinators and other beneficial insects. 

Urban gardening also addresses limited access to fresh, affordable produce in urban areas and fosters a sense of community and connection to nature. Vertical farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics have become innovative technologies to maximize yields. Despite challenges such as access to land and soil contamination, the potential of urban gardening to transform cities and create a greener, healthier, and more connected urban landscape is undeniable.
