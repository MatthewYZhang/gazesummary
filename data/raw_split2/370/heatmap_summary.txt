The Maya civilization, flourishing in Mesoamerica from approximately 250 to 900 CE, was a sophisticated culture known for their advancements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. During the Classic Period, the Maya established independent city-states, such as Tikal, Palenque, and Copán. These city-states engaged in trade and sometimes warfare. Their society was stratified, with a ruling elite, priests, warriors, artisans, and farmers forming distinct social classes.

The Maya developed a hieroglyphic writing system and were skilled astronomers, accurately predicting eclipses. They developed a complex calendar system and had advanced mathematical understanding including the concept of zero. Their religious beliefs centered on a pantheon of gods and goddesses, and they performed rituals and ceremonies.

The Maya constructed monumental pyramids, temples, palaces, and ballcourts, demonstrating their advanced engineering skills. However, around 900 CE, the Maya civilization experienced a decline in the southern lowlands. The causes of this collapse are debated but likely involve environmental degradation, warfare, and political instability. Theories point to overpopulation, deforestation, intensive agriculture, and prolonged drought. The Maya culture persisted in the northern Yucatán Peninsula. The rise and fall of the Maya civilization offer valuable lessons about the interplay between environment, society, and culture, serving as a cautionary tale.
