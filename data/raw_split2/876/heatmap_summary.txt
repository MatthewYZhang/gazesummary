The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century was a pivotal moment that revolutionized European society. Before this, books were painstakingly handwritten by monks, a slow and labor-intensive process that made books expensive and scarce, restricting access to knowledge to the wealthy elite and clergy. Gutenberg's press, developed around 1440, used movable type made from metal, making printing more flexible and efficient. He also developed an oil-based ink that adhered well to the metal type.

The printing press's impact was immediate, making books more affordable and accessible and spurring a dramatic increase in literacy rates. The printing press also played a critical role in the Renaissance, facilitating the rapid spread of ideas. Martin Luther's pamphlets and treatises, which challenged the authority of the Catholic Church, were also quickly disseminated throughout Europe, fueling the religious upheaval that transformed the continent. The printing press contributed to the standardization of languages. The legacy of the printing press is undeniable as it democratized knowledge.
