The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica between 250 to 900 AD, marked by sophisticated advancements in calendar systems, hieroglyphic writing, and architectural marvels. However, this civilization experienced a mysterious decline, leading to the abandonment of major cities and a decrease in population. Various theories suggest that this collapse was due to the environmental factor, particularly climate change, as paleoclimatic data showed prolonged and severe droughts affected the region around the 9th century AD.

The droughts decimated agricultural production, resulting in food shortages and social unrest, which led to the abandonment of cities. Evidence supporting this theory included the analysis of oxygen isotopes in lake sediments that indicate a period of increased aridity and malnutrition found in skeletal remains. Deforestation and soil degradation were also contributing factors, with increased demand for arable land leading to widespread deforestation, which resulted in soil erosion and decreased agricultural productivity. Internal political and social factors, such as competition for resources and warfare, also played a role in the Maya collapse, which was likely not a single factor but rather a combination of environmental, social, and political pressures. Despite this decline, Maya people survived and adapted, with new Maya states emerging. Millions of Maya people still live in Mesoamerica today, preserving their heritage.
