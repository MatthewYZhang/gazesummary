Invasive species, also known as exotic or non-native species, are organisms introduced outside their natural range, causing ecological, economic, or human health problems by outcompeting native species, altering habitats, and disrupting ecosystem processes. These introductions are often facilitated by human activities. The mechanisms by which invasive species exert their impacts are diverse, with competition being a primary factor due to their efficient resource exploitation traits. The zebra mussel, for example, filters plankton, and the brown tree snake decimated native bird and reptile populations on Guam.

Habitat alteration is a significant impact, like the salt cedar reducing water availability. Invasive species can also modify fire regimes, increasing wildfires. Economically, invasive species significantly impact agriculture and forestry, increasing costs and disrupting timber production. Preventing their introduction is crucial, involving stricter regulations, border inspections, and public education. Control efforts, including physical removal, chemical treatments, and biological control, are often challenging and expensive.

Coral reefs are highly diverse ecosystems threatened by environmental stressors like coral bleaching and ocean acidification. Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel zooxanthellae due to stress, leading to pale or white coloration and increased vulnerability. Ocean acidification, caused by increased atmospheric CO2, reduces the availability of carbonate ions, weakening coral skeletons and inhibiting growth. The primary driver for both is increased CO2 from human activities. A multifaceted approach is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect coral reefs from other stressors, and restore damaged areas to ensure the future health of these vital ecosystems.
