The role of play in cognitive development is increasingly recognized as a crucial mechanism through which children construct knowledge, develop problem-solving skills, and foster social-emotional growth. Traditionally, structured learning was emphasized, but researchers now highlight unstructured, child-directed play, particularly the "zone of proximal development," where children learn by engaging in activities slightly beyond their capabilities with support. Different types of play are linked to specific cognitive benefits. Construction play enhances spatial reasoning, problem-solving, and fine motor skills, requiring children to visualize structures and plan their construction. Pretend play has been linked to increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for cognitive functions such as planning, impulse control, and working memory. Play also fosters social-emotional development through interactions with peers, teaching children to negotiate and resolve conflicts, building emotional intelligence and fostering self-confidence. The decline of unstructured play in modern society is a growing concern, which may have detrimental effects on cognitive and social-emotional development. To ensure children benefit from play, it is important to recognize the value of different types of play.
