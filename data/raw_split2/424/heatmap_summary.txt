Dams have long been constructed for hydroelectric power, irrigation, flood control, and water storage but impact river ecosystems by affecting water flow, sediment transport, nutrient cycling, and aquatic life diversity. These impacts result from the alteration of natural flow regimes and the disruption of sediment transport. Dams store water during high flows and release it during low flows, smoothing out natural flow variations and disrupting the life cycles of aquatic organisms reliant on seasonal flow cues. Rivers naturally carry sediments downstream, replenishing riverbeds and delivering nutrients, but dams trap sediments, leading to erosion, habitat loss, and reduced nutrient availability downstream.

Dams also affect water temperature by creating stratified reservoirs, with altered temperatures affecting aquatic organisms, particularly temperature-sensitive species. Furthermore, dams disrupt nutrient cycling by trapping nutrients in the reservoir, reducing nutrient availability downstream, and affecting the food web. The construction of dams negatively impacts fish populations by blocking migration routes and altering habitat conditions. To address these impacts, strategies include fish ladders, restoring natural flow regimes, and sediment management. Carefully planning future dam construction, exploring alternative energy sources, and even removing outdated dams can minimize environmental impacts.
