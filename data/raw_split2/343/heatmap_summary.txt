The Mayan civilization, notable for its hieroglyphic writing and architectural achievements, thrived in Mesoamerica from 250 to 900 AD, influencing a large area including present-day Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, and parts of Mexico. This civilization was characterized by a complex social hierarchy. The economy was based on agriculture. Mayan society consisted of independent city-states ruled by kings, which often engaged in warfare. One of the most remarkable aspects of Mayan civilization was their intellectual prowess, leading to advanced writing and mathematics.

The Classic Maya civilization experienced a decline. One theory is that environmental factors led to agricultural failures and food shortages, possibly exacerbated by overpopulation. Another theory emphasizes the role of warfare and political instability, disrupting trade networks. A third theory proposes that changing trade routes and economic shifts played a role. The Terminal Classic period saw a population decline, abandonment of cities, and a stop to construction, and the civilization never fully recovered. Their achievements in mathematics, astronomy, and architecture remain significant.
