Artificial light at night (ALAN), recognized as light pollution, significantly impacts ecosystems despite its benefits. Its proliferation due to urbanization and industrial activities raises ecological concerns. One major effect is the disruption of animal behavior, particularly in nocturnal species, with ALAN altering navigation, foraging, reproduction, and predator avoidance. Migratory birds, for instance, are drawn to brightly lit areas, leading to collisions and exhaustion. Similarly, sea turtles can become disoriented by artificial lights and crawl inland. Insects are also affected as nocturnal species are attracted to light sources, leading to mortality and affecting plant pollination. The impact of ALAN also includes plant physiology as it affects aquatic ecosystems, leading to altered behavior in organisms and disruption of fish migration. Addressing ALAN requires strategies such as lighting regulations, shielded light fixtures, and public awareness campaigns. Technological advancements like adaptive lighting offer promising solutions. Ultimately, minimizing ALAN's impact is crucial for preserving biodiversity, requiring responsible lighting practices and effective regulations for a sustainable environment.
