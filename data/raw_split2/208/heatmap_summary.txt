Cahokia, a remarkable urban center that emerged around 1050 CE in the Mississippi River floodplains, represents the pinnacle of Mississippian culture. The city experienced a gradual decline and eventual abandonment due to intertwined factors.

The environment played a key role, with Cahokia's agricultural success relying on the rich alluvial soils deposited by the Mississippi. However, over-intensive farming practices, such as maize cultivation, likely led to deforestation and soil erosion, increasing the frequency of floods and impacting crop yields.

Social and political dynamics were also important, as Cahokia was ruled by an elite class. The construction of monumental earthworks like Monks Mound, required significant labor, fostering resentment. Archaeological evidence also suggests periods of conflict. Another factor contributing to the city's decline may have been overpopulation. The decline was not a sudden event but rather a gradual process.
