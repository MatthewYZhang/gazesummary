Aquaponics, combining aquaculture and hydroponics, represents a sustainable food production method gaining increasing attention. The earliest forms of aquaponics arose independently in various cultures, such as the Aztec civilization's "chinampas," artificial islands built in shallow lakes and canals from layers of mud and decaying vegetation. Fish contributed to the nutrient cycle, providing natural fertilizer for plants. Similarly, Southeast Asian rice paddies integrated fish farming for pest control and fertilization.

Modern aquaponics emerged in the 20th century, with researchers exploring closed-loop systems to minimize waste and conserve resources. These experiments focused on understanding nutrient cycles, specifically converting fish waste into nitrates. One significant breakthrough was the development of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) allowing greater control over water quality. RAS systems use filters to remove solid waste and biofilters to convert ammonia into nitrates, channeling the nutrient-rich water to hydroponic beds. Various hydroponic techniques have been adapted, including DWC, NFT, and media beds. The growth of aquaponics is driven by concerns about food security and environmental sustainability.
