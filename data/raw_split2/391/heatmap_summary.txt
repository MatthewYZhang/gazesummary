Agriculture is a pivotal development, transforming nomadic societies into settled communities and laying the groundwork for civilizations. While the precise origins are complex, archaeological and genetic evidence offers insights. Agriculture is thought to have emerged independently in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East around 10,000-12,000 years ago, which includes parts of Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran. This area had a wide variety of wild cereals and legumes, making it a good place to experiment with growing plants. Sites like Jericho and Abu Hureyra have archaeological evidence that people in this area were growing wheat, barley, lentils, and other crops. Domestication of animals like sheep, goats, pigs, and cattle also provided reliable meat, milk, and labor. However, recent research suggests agriculture arose independently in other regions. It led to increased food production, supporting larger populations, and villages. Surplus food enabled specialization in crafts, trade, and governance, leading to social hierarchies. Despite challenges like crop failures, agriculture transformed societies and is key to understanding human history.
