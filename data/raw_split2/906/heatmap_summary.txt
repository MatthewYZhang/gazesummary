Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a rapidly increasing pervasive form of pollution that is causing significant ecological disruption. Species have evolved under natural light, and the introduction of artificial light disrupts these natural cycles. The impact on migratory birds is severe, as artificial lights disorient birds.

ALAN can also negatively impact sea turtles. Coastal development can disorient hatchlings, leading them inland instead of toward the sea. This disorientation can lead to dehydration and increased predation risk. Female turtles can be disoriented by ALAN, nesting in unsuitable areas. For insects, many nocturnal insects are attracted to light. This attraction can disrupt their foraging behavior, reproduction, and dispersal. For example, moths become easy prey for bats near streetlights, reducing moth populations.

Addressing ALAN requires reducing light emitted and using light sources less attractive to wildlife, such as red and amber lights. Efforts to mitigate ALAN's impacts have shown promise, requiring widespread adoption to preserve wildlife.
