The invention of cuneiform writing in ancient Mesopotamia marked a pivotal moment, transitioning from prehistory to history. Evolving from simple pictograms around 3400 BCE to a complex system capable of expressing abstract ideas, cuneiform, meaning "wedge-shaped," was initially used for administrative purposes, like tracking agricultural surpluses. The need to represent abstract concepts led to the stylization of pictograms into abstract symbols, enhancing writing efficiency.

The introduction of phonetic symbols, representing spoken language sounds, further expanded cuneiform's expressive power, enabling the representation of abstract ideas and proper names. Cuneiform was used for diverse purposes, including administrative records, legal documents such as the laws of Hammurabi, literary texts, and religious texts. The Epic of Gilgamesh was written in cuneiform, helping standardize language and culture. The decipherment of cuneiform in the 19th century opened up a vast treasure trove of knowledge about the history and culture of ancient Mesopotamia.
