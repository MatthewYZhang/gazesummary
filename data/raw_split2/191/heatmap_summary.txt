Plate tectonics explains many geological features, viewing the Earth's surface as dynamic. The Earth's lithosphere consists of large and small plates that float on the asthenosphere, interacting at their boundaries. There are three types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. At divergent boundaries, plates move apart, forming new oceanic crust via magma upwelling, exemplified by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. At convergent boundaries, plates collide resulting in processes like subduction, deep-sea trenches, volcanic arcs, and earthquakes. The collision of continental plates forms towering mountain ranges like the Himalayas. Convection currents in the mantle are thought to drive plate motion, along with ridge push and slab pull. Plate tectonics revolutionized the understanding of geology, explaining the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, the formation of mountain ranges, and the movement of continents. This theory remains evolving, and it is crucial for understanding seismic and volcanic hazards.
