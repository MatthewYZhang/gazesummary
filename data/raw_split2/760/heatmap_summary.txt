Scientists recognize play as a crucial part of animal development, especially in mammals and birds, influencing cognitive development, social bonds, and survival skills. Play offers a safe space for young animals to practice crucial behaviors, honing skills, coordination, and learning about capabilities. Social interactions in play facilitate social skills and communication development. Deficits are often observed in animals later in life after play deprivation.

The "cognitive development theory" suggests play stimulates brain growth and flexibility, and involves manipulating objects, exploring novel environments and adapting to unexpected situations, challenging the brain and promoting its development. Comparative studies also support this hypothesis and show a correlation between play behaviors and the size of the brain.

Recent research has focused on the neurobiological mechanisms that show play impacts brain function and structure. Providing play opportunities in captivity can enhance well-being and promote development. Studying animal play can offer insights into human play and its role in fostering important skills.
