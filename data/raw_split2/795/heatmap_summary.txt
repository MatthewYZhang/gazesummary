The development of agriculture, including the cultivation of plants and domestication of animals, marked a significant turning point by enabling settled communities, increased food production, and the rise of civilizations. One theory posits that the need for agriculture arose from resource scarcity due to climate changes during the late Pleistocene epoch, which led to altered landscapes and shifts in plant and animal distribution. In the Fertile Crescent, early evidence of agriculture is characterized by a Mediterranean climate and abundant wild grains. The origins of agriculture are complex and multifaceted, influenced by environmental pressures, accumulated knowledge, social transformations, and demographic changes. Deforestation and soil erosion resulted from agricultural practices. The combined effects of these factors paved the way for settled communities, increased food production, and the rise of civilizations.
