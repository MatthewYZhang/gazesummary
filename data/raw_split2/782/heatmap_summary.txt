Jazz music's development is rooted in the cultural landscape of late 19th and early 20th-century America, originating with enslaved Africans who retained their musical traditions despite bondage. These traditions, infused with rhythms and harmonies, found expression in work songs, spirituals, and blues, laying the groundwork for jazz. After the Civil War, African Americans sought new opportunities, making New Orleans a melting pot for musical innovation where European brass band music, Caribbean rhythms, and African American folk traditions converged. The Swing Era of the 1930s saw the rise of big bands led by Duke Ellington and Count Basie, whose compositions captivated audiences. In the 1970s, jazz fused with rock, funk, and electronic music through artists like Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock. Despite transformations, jazz retains its values of improvisation, innovation, and individuality, reflecting freedom, creativity, and cultural exchange.
