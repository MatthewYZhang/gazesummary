Cahokia, located in present-day Illinois across the Mississippi River from St. Louis, flourished from approximately 1050 to 1350 CE and was the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico. As the center of a complex Mississippian culture, Cahokia dominated a vast network of settlements throughout the Mississippi River Valley, boasting a population estimated between 10,000 and 20,000.

The city's most striking feature is its monumental earthworks, including over 120 mounds, ranging in size from small platforms to the colossal Monks Mound. Monks Mound, the largest earthen structure in North America, rises over 100 feet and covers 14 acres, serving as residential platforms, temples, and burial sites. The city's inhabitants cultivated maize, beans, squash, and sunflowers, facilitating trade with distant communities. Its monumental earthworks, sophisticated social structure, and complex religious beliefs offer a glimpse into a fascinating chapter of North American history, and ongoing archaeological research continues to unravel the mysteries of its rise and fall.
