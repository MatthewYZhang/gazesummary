Bird migration is a captivating phenomenon, with millions of birds making biannual journeys that often span continents. These migrations are triggered by a complex interplay of internal and external factors, ensuring access to optimal breeding grounds and feeding resources throughout the year. Birds rely on a combination of environmental signals for guidance, including solar orientation and geomagnetism. Solar orientation involves the use of an internal clock to maintain a consistent angle relative to the sun. Geomagnetism, or the Earth's magnetic field, is another important tool, with birds possessing specialized cells in their eyes and brains that are sensitive to magnetic fields. Scientists use various techniques to study bird migration, including bird banding and sophisticated tracking devices. Advancements in technology have led to the development of satellite transmitters and geolocators, which provide detailed information on birds' movements. However, many questions remain unanswered regarding bird migration, including the precise mechanisms by which birds sense and process magnetic fields.

The formation of planetary systems represents a fundamental aspect of cosmic evolution, transforming swirling clouds of gas and dust into organized structures. The process begins with a molecular cloud, which collapses and fragments into smaller, denser cores. These cores form a protostar at the center, surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. Within the disk, dust grains collide and stick together, forming planetesimals that grow through gravitational attraction. The fate of protoplanets depends on their location within the disk, with rocky planets forming closer to the star and gas giants forming further away.
