The development of printing in Europe during the late 15th century, particularly movable type, catalyzed a revolution led by Johannes Gutenberg, reshaping society and intellectual life. Before the printing press, knowledge was mainly for the elite, with painstakingly copied manuscripts being expensive and scarce. Gutenberg's innovation of movable type and the screw press allowed mass production of books, exemplified by the Gutenberg Bible in the 1450s. The printing press increased book availability, leading to higher literacy rates and broader engagement with literature and scholarly works. The printing press played a significant role in the standardization of language, with printers favoring vernacular languages.

The period between the 16th and 18th centuries witnessed changes in warfare with the decline of feudal armies and the rise of centralized states. Gunpowder technology revolutionized battlefield tactics, with cannons breaching castle walls. Handheld firearms provided infantry with a new capability, gradually replacing the longbow and spear. The increasing importance of firearms shifted the infantry formations. Centralized states established professional armies.
