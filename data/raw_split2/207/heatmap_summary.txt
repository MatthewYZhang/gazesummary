Microplastic pollution is an unprecedented threat to the world's oceans. These tiny plastic particles originate from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, industrial processes, and the direct release of microbeads, persisting in the environment and accumulating over time. Microplastics are ubiquitous in the marine environment, including surface waters and deep-sea sediments. Their widespread distribution stems from the transport of plastic waste via rivers and wind, industrial processes, and microbeads.

Microplastics resemble natural food particles and are ingested by marine organisms, leading to bioaccumulation, where the concentration of microplastics increases up the food chain, posing risks to top predators. They can also leach toxic chemicals, and act as vectors for the transport of other pollutants, increasing the exposure of marine organisms to harmful chemicals. Microplastics can alter the structure and function of marine sediments.

Addressing microplastic pollution requires reducing plastic waste entering the environment through measures such as recycling and reducing single-use plastics. Raising public awareness and encouraging responsible consumption habits can reduce the demand for plastic products.
