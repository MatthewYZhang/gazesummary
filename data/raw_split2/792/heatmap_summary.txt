Vertical farming represents a modern agricultural revolution, driven by challenges like climate change and population growth. This innovative approach involves cultivating crops in vertically stacked layers within controlled environments. Unlike traditional open-field farms, vertical farms, often housed in warehouses, skyscrapers, or shipping containers, enable year-round crop production. Sophisticated technologies like hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics are utilized to optimize plant growth, with LED lighting providing necessary illumination. These farms offer enhanced control over growing conditions, reducing the need for pesticides and herbicides. Additionally, locating farms near urban centers reduces transportation costs and emissions. The initial costs, energy consumption, and limited crop range pose challenges, but investments in vertical farming initiatives signal a growing recognition of its potential to address food security.
