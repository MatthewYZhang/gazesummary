Cahokia was the largest and most influential urban center of the Mississippian culture, flourishing from around 800 to 1400 AD, and its rapid rise and decline presents a case study in the complexities of ancient societies. Its establishment was characterized by sudden and explosive growth, witnessing the construction of monumental earthworks such as Monks Mound, and a sophisticated agricultural system. Cahokia's surge in population was due to the fertile floodplain of the Mississippi River providing abundant resources for agriculture, especially maize, which allowed for a surplus of food. Cahokia's strategic location also facilitated trade and communication with other Mississippian centers. However, the success of Cahokia was not sustainable and around 1250 AD, the city began to decline, possibly due to environmental degradation and overpopulation. By 1400 AD, Cahokia had been largely abandoned, leaving a lasting legacy on the Mississippian culture. Today, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
