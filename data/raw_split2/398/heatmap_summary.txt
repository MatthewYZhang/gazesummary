Cahokia, the largest urban center of the Mississippian culture near Collinsville, Illinois, flourished from 800 to 1400 CE, with its peak around 1100 CE, when it possibly rivaled some European cities in population. Known for its monumental earthworks, it offers insights into pre-Columbian North American societies. The most distinguishing feature is its extensive network of over 120 earthen mounds. These mounds, varying in size and shape, included Monks Mound, the largest prehistoric earthwork north of Mexico. They served as residential platforms, ceremonial spaces, and burial sites. Theories for Cahokia's decline include overpopulation, resource depletion, internal conflicts, and prolonged drought, possibly stemming from an earthquake. Cahokia's legacy includes its cultural and technological influences on subsequent societies, and it now stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Further research shows possible internal issues in the city, such as distinct burials between commoners and elites, and a wooden palisade which may suggest a fear of attack.
