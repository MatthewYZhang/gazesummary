The Maya civilization, known for its advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and art, flourished in Mesoamerica from approximately 250 CE to 900 CE, relying on a sophisticated agricultural system. Early Maya agriculture likely used swidden techniques, clearing and burning forests to release nutrients into the soil for planting crops like maize, beans, and squash. This method, effective in the short term, depleted soil fertility, requiring farmers to relocate, which proved unsustainable as populations grew. The Classic Maya period saw the emergence of more intensive practices, including raised fields known as chinampas, artificial islands in wetlands with canals providing water and transportation. Water management was also crucial, including reservoirs to collect rainwater and irrigation systems to distribute water during the dry season, along with terracing to prevent soil erosion. The decline of the Maya civilization in the 9th century CE has been linked in part to agriculture problems. Climate change and droughts also contributed to agricultural failures. Agriculture played a critical role in the rise and fall of this civilization.
