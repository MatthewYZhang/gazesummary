During the Mississippian period, a remarkable civilization flourished in the Mississippi River Valley, with Cahokia as its largest and most influential urban center. Cahokia's rise and decline offer valuable insights into the social, political, and environmental dynamics of pre-Columbian North America. Its prominence was built upon a strategic location at the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois Rivers, allowing control of trade routes and access to resources. The alluvial soils supported intensive maize agriculture, with the "Three Sisters" (maize, beans, and squash) enabling surplus production. Central to Cahokia's urban landscape were earthen mounds, including Monk's Mound, which served as platforms for residences, temples, and other structures. Cahokia was a stratified society, possibly a chiefdom, with elites controlling resources and directing religious ceremonies. Cahokia's influence extended far beyond its vicinity, with its art style spreading throughout the Mississippi River Valley. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
