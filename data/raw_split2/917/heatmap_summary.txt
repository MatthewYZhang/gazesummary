Coral reefs face coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, which provide food and vibrant colors. When temperatures rise, corals expel these algae, leading to bleaching. Bleached corals are weakened and susceptible to death. Climate change is the primary driver, with even slight temperature increases triggering events. Ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing also contribute. Strategies to mitigate coral bleaching include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water quality, and managing fisheries. The long-term survival of coral reefs depends on addressing the root causes of coral bleaching, primarily climate change. Reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to a sustainable, low-carbon economy are essential steps to protect these vital ecosystems for future generations. The challenge is significant, but the stakes are too high to ignore. The future of coral reefs, and the many species that depend on them, hangs in the balance.
