Sleep plays a fundamental role in memory consolidation, where newly acquired information is stabilized and integrated into long-term memory. While the underlying mechanisms are still being investigated, sleep facilitates the strengthening of neural connections and the reorganization of memory networks. Different stages of sleep, characterized by unique brainwave patterns, are critical for memory consolidation. REM sleep is associated with vivid dreaming and increased brain activity, whereas SWS is characterized by slow brainwaves and reduced metabolic activity. Sleep deprivation, particularly REM sleep deprivation, can impair memory performance. Individuals deprived of sleep after learning exhibit poorer recall. During SWS, declarative memories may be primarily consolidated. Sleep may also play a role in emotional regulation and memory processing by dampening the emotional intensity of experiences. Sleep is an active process that actively contributes to memory formation and allows the brain to selectively strengthen relevant neural connections while weakening irrelevant ones. Sleep may allow the brain to integrate fragmented memories into a coherent and meaningful whole. In conclusion, sleep plays an active and essential role in the formation of long-term memories.
