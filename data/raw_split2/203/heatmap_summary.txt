Archaeological and historical records provide insights into the evolution of agricultural practices across different civilizations, with early agriculture characterized by small-scale, subsistence farming centered on staple crops. The transition involved domestication, selecting plants and animals with desirable traits. Early techniques emerged in Mesopotamia's Fertile Crescent, including irrigation to manage water resources. Ancient Egyptians used irrigation along the Nile River for wheat, barley, and flax, while the Indus Valley civilization cultivated wheat, barley, and cotton. The development of irrigation systems and the wheel facilitated cultivation in areas with limited rainfall and efficient transportation of products. Modern agriculture involves synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and genetically modified crops, raising environmental and health concerns. Future practices should focus on sustainable farming systems to address climate change, population growth, and resource scarcity.
