The Silk Road was a network of trade routes that crisscrossed Asia for centuries, originating around the 2nd century BCE and lasting until the 15th century CE. Its impact on global history, culture, and technology is undeniable. Besides the exchange of goods, it facilitated the spread of ideas, religions, and artistic styles, creating a dynamic cross-cultural exchange. It connected East Asia, primarily China, with the Mediterranean world and beyond.

The Silk Road also served as a vital artery for the spread of ideas and beliefs. Buddhism, originating in India, spread eastward along the Silk Road, taking root in Central Asia, China, Korea, and Japan. Along with the religion itself, Buddhist art, architecture, and philosophy profoundly influenced the cultures of these regions. China's "Belt and Road Initiative" serves as a reminder of the historical significance of the Silk Road as a bridge between East and West.
