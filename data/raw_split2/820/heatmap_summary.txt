The evolution of flight has occurred independently in several groups, including insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals (bats). The evolutionary pathways and anatomical adaptations leading to flight have differed considerably, offering insights into adaptation and diversification. Birds are widely believed to have evolved from feathered dinosaurs, with the "trees-down" hypothesis suggesting flight originated from gliding and leaping in tree-dwelling ancestors. This theory posits that early proto-birds used feathered forelimbs to parachute or glide, gradually improving control.

In contrast, the evolution of bat flight is more enigmatic. Although the prevailing hypothesis also suggests a "trees-down" origin, some propose a "ground-up" origin from running or leaping terrestrial ancestors. The anatomical adaptations that facilitated bat flight are distinct from those of birds. Bats possess elongated fingers connected by a patagium, creating a flexible wing surface supported by bone and muscle. They also use echolocation to navigate. Despite these differences, flight in birds and bats exemplifies convergent evolution, where different lineages evolve similar traits due to similar pressures. The pectoral muscles are proportionally larger in bats than in most other mammals.
