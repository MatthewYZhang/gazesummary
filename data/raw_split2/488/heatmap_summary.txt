Coffee's journey from an Ethiopian practice to a global phenomenon is marked by geographical shifts, cultural adoptions, and technological advancements. The story begins in the highlands of Ethiopia with the *Coffea arabica* plant. According to legend, a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats becoming unusually energetic after consuming the plant's berries. By the 15th century, coffee consumption had become integrated into Sufi religious practices in Yemen, aiding in staying awake for prayers and meditation. These early coffee houses, *qahveh khaneh*, became centers of social and intellectual exchange. From there, coffee spread throughout the Ottoman Empire and then to Europe, becoming a center for business, politics, and intellectual discourse. The colonial expansion had a profound impact on the landscapes and economies of these regions. The invention of instant coffee and the rise of multinational chains like Starbucks led to further transformations of coffee culture. Today, coffee continues to evolve with new brewing methods and flavor profiles.
