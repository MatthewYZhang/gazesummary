Rumors, unsubstantiated information circulating through a population, are a common part of social life and can be damaging. The psychology behind rumors involves cognitive biases, emotional needs, and social dynamics, which can help understand how rumors spread and impact society. Uncertainty is a key factor in rumor propagation, particularly during times of rapid change such as economic downturns or political upheaval. People turn to rumors to make sense of their environment and to fill the information void. Rumors often provide simplified explanations, easier to understand than fact-based analyses.

Emotions, such as fear, anger, or excitement, make stories more likely to be shared, enhancing attention, memory, and social transmission. A frightening rumor about food contamination spreads rapidly as people seek protection, and emotional intensity can override critical thinking, leading to acceptance without scrutiny. The tendency to share information with like-minded individuals creates echo chambers that amplify rumors. Addressing uncertainty and fostering empathy are essential in combating rumors. Promoting critical thinking skills and media literacy is important to evaluate information effectively.
