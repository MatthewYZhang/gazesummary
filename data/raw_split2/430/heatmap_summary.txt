Coral reefs, known as the "rainforests of the sea", stand out for their biodiversity and productivity. They consist of colonies of coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate skeletons. Individual polyps are tiny, but their collective action over time leads to the formation of massive reefs. Coral reefs are found in shallow, tropical and subtropical waters where sunlight is abundant. The process of coral reef formation is slow and intricate. These reefs depend on the symbiotic relationship of corals and microscopic algae that perform photosynthesis. Coral reefs play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and turning it into calcium carbonate for their skeletons and are threatened by human activities like pollution, overfishing, and climate change. Ocean acidification inhibits coral growth. The future of coral reefs depends on efforts to address climate change and protect these ecosystems.
