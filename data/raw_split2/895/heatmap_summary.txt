The Great Barrier Reef (GBR), located off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is the world's largest coral reef system, made up of more than 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands that stretch more than 2,300 kilometers. It supports a wide range of marine life and plays a critical role in local and global biodiversity.

The GBR began to form approximately 20,000 years ago as sea levels rose following the last glacial period. Coral polyps built their calcium carbonate skeletons on the submerged continental shelf, forming the massive structure we know today. Coral polyps have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae provide the coral with food through photosynthesis, while the coral provides the algae with a protected environment and essential nutrients. This mutually beneficial relationship is crucial for the survival and growth of the coral.

However, the GBR is facing unprecedented threats from a variety of sources. Climate change is arguably the most significant threat. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching. Ocean acidification, also caused by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, reduces the availability of calcium carbonate, making it harder for corals to build their skeletons. Other threats include pollution from agricultural runoff, and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, a coral-eating predator. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, numerous conservation efforts are underway to protect the GBR.
