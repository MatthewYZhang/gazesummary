The Mississippian culture flourished in the central and southeastern United States, with Cahokia emerging as the largest and most influential urban center north of Mexico. Cahokia's success was significantly based on its fertile floodplain environment along the Mississippi River, where skilled farmers cultivated maize, beans, and squash. This agricultural surplus supported a substantial population, estimated to have reached between 10,000 and 20,000, leading to a stratified society under a powerful elite.

Starting around 1300 CE, the city began to decline, and Cahokia was largely abandoned by the 1400s, leaving behind a legacy of monumental earthworks. Numerous theories suggest that the decline was due to environmental factors like deforestation, climate change and due to a combination of environmental, social, political, and possibly biological factors. Despite its fall, Cahokia remains a testament to the ingenuity and organizational abilities of the Mississippian people.
