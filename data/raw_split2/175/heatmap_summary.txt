Bird migration, a spectacular natural phenomenon, remains a subject of scientific inquiry. Migratory birds undertake long journeys, aligning with seasonal resource availability and favorable conditions, while facing challenges in energy expenditure and navigation. The exact evolutionary origins of migration are debated between the "Tropical Origin" hypothesis, proposing the expansion from short-distance movements in tropical regions, and the "Temperate Origin" hypothesis, suggesting migration arose as a means to escape harsh winters and return to breeding grounds.

Environmental factors exert a strong influence on migration patterns, with climate change, habitat loss, and human activities disrupting migratory routes and negatively impacting bird populations. Climate change alters seasonal event timings, causing mismatches between bird migration and resource availability. Habitat loss diminishes stopover sites for resting and refueling, and light pollution disorients nocturnal migrants. Conservation is crucial for migratory bird populations, with international collaborations safeguarding habitats. Efforts like habitat restoration and mitigating light pollution and pesticide use are essential for survival.
