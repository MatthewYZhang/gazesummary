Aquaponics combines aquaculture and hydroponics, gaining popularity and a history that extends into the past with independent discovery by various cultures. The modern integrated aquaponics system resulted from decades of scientific research. Aztecs practiced early forms of aquaponics by raising plants on rafts in shallow lake waters, using nutrient-rich sediment and fish waste. Southeast Asia employed similar systems.

In the 20th century, the New Alchemy Institute experimented with integrated aquaculture and hydroponics, creating closed-loop ecosystems to produce food sustainably while minimizing waste.

Beneficial bacteria that convert ammonia into less toxic nitrates were crucial in creating stable aquaponics systems. Commercial aquaponics emerged as research progressed and the technology matured. Aquaponics offers a solution to concerns about food security, environmental sustainability, and resource scarcity. Research efforts aim to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and expand the range of crops and fish produced. Aquaponics is poised to play an increasingly important role in the future of agriculture.
