The fertile crescent of Mesopotamia, between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, witnessed the birth of influential cities that left an indelible mark on human history. The emergence of cities like Uruk, Ur, and Babylon is attributed to the regionâ€™s agricultural productivity. Reliable water supply allowed for intensive irrigation, resulting in surplus food production, enabling specialization in crafts, trade, and administration, which fostered urban growth. The need for organized irrigation led to the development of centralized authority and complex social structures.

However, the very environmental factors that fueled the rise of these cities also contributed to their downfall, because intensive irrigation led to salinization of the soil, reducing agricultural yields over time. Deforestation exacerbated soil erosion and altered local climate patterns. External pressures from migrating peoples and invading empires contributed to the fragility of Mesopotamian cities. Each conquest brought destruction and political instability, weakening the cities and their capacity to recover from environmental challenges.
