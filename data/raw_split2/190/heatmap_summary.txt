Artificial light increasingly illuminates the modern world, especially affecting nocturnal and crepuscular animals. While its astronomical impacts are noted, the effects on animal behavior and ecology are still emerging. Artificial light at night can disrupt an animal's life, affecting navigation, foraging, reproduction, and communication, which impacts population dynamics and ecosystem stability. Many migratory species like birds and sea turtles depend on natural light for navigation. Artificial light can disorient them, leading to collisions and wasted energy. For example, baby sea turtles move inland instead of towards the ocean, leading to dehydration and death, and migratory birds drawn to brightly lit buildings suffer fatal collisions. Artificial light can also disrupt the hunting efficiency of nocturnal predators. It interferes with visual and acoustic communication, affecting animals' ability to find mates or avoid predators. There are strategies to mitigate these effects, such as reducing light intensity and using warmer color temperatures. Play is crucial for animal development and contributes to physical, cognitive, and social skills. Young animals use it to refine physical abilities. Play aids cognitive development, helping animals learn and adapt, and helps establish social bonds.
