Every year, millions of monarch butterflies travel thousands of miles from their summer breeding grounds to overwintering sites in Mexico and California. This migration is a awe-inspiring, and scientists are making progress in understanding the mechanisms, but the cues and strategies remain mysterious. The migratory generation is longer-lived and driven by an innate urge to reach warmer climates, puzzled researchers for decades. The changing day length is one key factor. The decreasing sunlight triggers hormonal changes. Monarchs use the sun position in the sky, detecting polarized light to maintain heading, but this alone is not enough. Monarchs have magnetic particles in their abdomens, allowing them to sense direction and intensity. Visual landmarks and scents can help monarchs stay on course. The monarchs that reach overwintering sites are great-grandchildren of those who started, with migratory knowledge passed down. Despite facing habitat loss and climate change, monarchs continue their journey, and scientists hope to protect them.

In forests, glowing fungi illuminate the darkness, also known as "foxfire." These fungi produce light through bioluminescence, but the reasons why remain a puzzle. Bioluminescence attracts insects to disperse their spores. It may also serve as a warning signal to deter herbivores. This helps to reduce oxidative stress. The diversity and complexity of fungal bioluminescence may be context-dependent. Bioluminescence is further influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Scientists combine approaches to unravel functions and discover new insights.
