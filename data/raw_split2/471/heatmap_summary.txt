Developmental psychologists have long recognized the importance of play in a child's cognitive, social, and emotional development. Play fosters learning, creativity, and crucial life skills. Children actively construct their knowledge and understanding of the world through play and they are not passively receiving information but actively experimenting, problem-solving, and negotiating social interactions.

Collaborative play also develops empathy, where children consider the perspectives and feelings of others during role-playing scenarios. Social skills like compromise and conflict resolution are taught through resolving conflicts. Emotionally, children can express their feelings, experiment with different roles, and regulate their emotions. Play offers a safe space to explore their emotions in a non-threatening context, develop coping mechanisms, and enhance their emotional intelligence. Overly structured or directed play can stifle creativity and limit the benefits derived from self-directed exploration.

Modern society often undervalues the importance of play. Therefore, creating environments that prioritize play, both at home and in schools, is essential for fostering healthy child development.
