Urban sprawl, also known as suburban sprawl, is the expansion of human populations away from central urban areas into low-density, car-dependent communities, often characterized by single-family homes on large lots, shopping malls, and extensive road networks, leading to a decline in the vibrancy of older urban centers and several environmental, social, and economic consequences. Since the mid-20th century, the phenomenon has dramatically increased due to factors like increased automobile ownership, government policies promoting suburban development, and a societal preference for larger homes.

The impacts of urban sprawl include environmental degradation and increased reliance on automobiles, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and air pollution. The homogeneous nature of many suburban communities can limit diversity and cultural exchange.

To combat the negative impacts of urban sprawl, cities and regions are adopting strategies to promote sustainable development, encourage mixed-use development, invest in public transportation, and preserve open space. The transition to more sustainable urban environments requires a fundamental shift in thinking. By prioritizing compact, mixed-use, and transit-oriented growth, planners can help to create more sustainable, equitable, and economically prosperous communities.
