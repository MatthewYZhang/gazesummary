The Maya civilization, which flourished in Mesoamerica from 250 AD to 900 AD, was a complex and sophisticated society with achievements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. The Classic Maya period saw the construction of cities like Tikal, Palenque, and Cop√°n. Society was stratified with a ruling elite and an economy based on agriculture, including maize, beans, and squash. They developed a complex writing system and a calendar system.

The Maya civilization experienced a decline around the 9th century AD, leading to city abandonment and population decline. A prominent theory for this collapse focuses on environmental factors such as overpopulation, soil depletion, and droughts, which could have severely impacted the Maya's ability to sustain their population. The arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century decimated the Maya population, suppressing their culture. However, Maya descendants continue to live in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras.
