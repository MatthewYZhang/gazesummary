The Harappan Civilization, flourishing in the Indus River Valley from approximately 3300 to 1700 BCE, exemplifies early urban planning, sophisticated water management, and trade. The Indus River provided the lifeblood for agriculture, with the Harappans developing advanced irrigation systems using canals and reservoirs to cultivate crops. They used wells for drinking water and irrigation, which fostered a resilient agricultural system.

Urban planning was defining, with cities planned with a grid pattern of streets, standardized brick sizes, and drainage systems. The Great Bath exemplifies their sanitation understanding. Drainage systems removed wastewater, contributing to the urban population's health. Trade played a crucial role in the Harappan economy and facilitated stability and prosperity.

The Harappan civilization eventually declined, and the reasons for its demise remain a subject of scholarly debate. Environmental changes, social and economic disruptions, and potential invasions likely contributed.
Changes in the Indus River's course or drought may have disrupted agricultural production. Deforestation exacerbated soil erosion and reduced rainfall, and overexploitation of their environment depleted resources. The concentration of wealth and power may have led to social tensions and resentment, and a decline in trade weakened the economy. Some scholars believe invasions by nomadic groups contributed to the civilization's decline. The civilization's sophisticated systems allowed it to flourish for centuries.
