Easter Island's colossal stone statues, known as Moai, stand as an enigma that continues to puzzle researchers. The statues are human figures carved from volcanic tuff, displaying elongated faces and prominent noses. Most were created at Rano Raraku, a volcanic crater, with some towering over 30 feet.

The islanders used basic stone tools and resources to carve, move, and raise the statues, and several theories exist. The "rock-and-roll" technique involves rocking the statues forward using ropes and levers. Another involves dragging the statues on wooden sleds or rollers with human labor and lubrication. Moving the Moai across the island was a major challenge, covering distances up to ten kilometers across rough ground. They may have been transported upright on wooden platforms or cradles, dragged with ropes and manpower. The island's lack of a written language and remote location makes documenting its history difficult, requiring careful analysis of archaeological evidence. By combining findings, accounts, and analysis, we better understand the Moai culture.
