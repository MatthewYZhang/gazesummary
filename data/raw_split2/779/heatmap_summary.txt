Impressionism was a revolutionary art movement that originated in France during the latter half of the 19th century, fundamentally altering the course of Western painting. It rejected traditional academic conventions and embraced a new emphasis on subjective perception and the fleeting qualities of light. Impressionist artists sought to capture the immediate sensory experience of the world around them, which was a departure from established norms, driven by technological advancements, evolving social attitudes, and disillusionment with grand historical and mythological themes.

One catalyst for Impressionism's rise was the invention of photography, which freed artists from creating accurate representations of reality. This allowed them to explore new ways of depicting the world and move away from meticulous detail toward a more interpretive approach. Another key factor was new paint technology. The invention of new, more portable paints allowed artists to paint outdoors more easily, focusing on natural light and *en plein air* painting. This allowed artists to capture the immediacy of the natural world, documenting fleeting moments.

Despite initial resistance and the rejection of their works by The Salon, Impressionism ultimately transformed the art world. Impressionists prioritized subjective perception, capturing light and embracing the modern world, changing how we experience the world.
