The deep-sea anglerfish, a suborder of around 160 species, is uniquely adapted to the perpetual darkness and immense pressure of its environment. One notable adaptation is the female's bioluminescent lure, a modified dorsal fin ray protruding over her head, tipped with a bulbous photophore filled with bioluminescent bacteria that attracts unsuspecting prey, which the anglerfish then engulfs with its large mouth and sharp teeth.

Another remarkable aspect of anglerfish biology is their unique mating strategy where the dwarfed male bites onto the female's body. The male fuses with the female, becoming permanently attached, and their tissues literally grow together. Over time, the male atrophies, becoming an external sperm-producing appendage, receiving nutrients from the female's bloodstream and in return provides sperm. This extreme form of sexual parasitism highlights the evolutionary pressures that have shaped the lives of deep-sea anglerfish.

The exact mechanisms for male-female fusion without immune response are being investigated. Researchers also believe that the anglerfish may possess a unique immune system that suppresses rejection, or that they may share common antigens that allow them to recognize each other as "self." Anglerfish play an important role in the deep-sea ecosystem. Ongoing research is providing new insights into their biology and ecology, with the development of new technologies.
