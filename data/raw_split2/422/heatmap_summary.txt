Mycorrhizae, symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, play a crucial role in forest ecosystems, particularly in nutrient cycling, plant growth, and overall forest resilience. The term "mycorrhiza" describes the mutually beneficial relationship wherein the fungus colonizes the plant root tissues. The plant provides the fungus with carbohydrates, while the fungus enhances the plant's access to water and nutrients from the soil.

There are two primary types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM). Ectomycorrhizae form a sheath around the outside of the root and extend hyphae into the spaces between root cells. The benefits of mycorrhizal associations include increased surface area for nutrient absorption, enhanced water uptake, and protection against soil pathogens. The importance of mycorrhizae is evident in nutrient-poor soils where plants rely on them for nutrients. Mycorrhizae also play a role in forest regeneration. Recent research has focused on using mycorrhizae to restore ecosystems and improve forest productivity.
