The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), a pivotal shift in Earth's history, occurred approximately 2.4 to 2.0 billion years ago, fundamentally altering the course of life. Prior to the GOE, Earth's atmosphere lacked free oxygen, favoring anaerobic organisms. The event marked a turning point with rising oxygen levels and profound changes in geochemistry, climate, and biology. Cyanobacteria, photosynthetic organisms producing oxygen as a byproduct, catalyzed the GOE.

The emergence of eukaryotes, characterized by compartmentalized cells and sexual reproduction, is considered a crucial step in the evolution of multicellular life. Anaerobic habitats became restricted to oxygen-poor niches, while aerobic organisms gained access to a wider range of environments. The GOE led to the oxidation of minerals and banded iron formations, and may have triggered "snowball Earth" events due to methane removal. Scientists use isotopic analyses and geochemical modeling to reconstruct the GOE. Understanding the GOE is crucial for understanding life's history and potential impacts of environmental changes. The GOE demonstrates how biological innovation can reshape a planet, with consequences for evolution.
