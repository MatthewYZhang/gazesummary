Megacities are urban areas with populations over 10 million, a relatively recent occurrence. Their rapid growth is driven by factors like economic opportunity, migration, and natural population increase, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Cities attract individuals seeking better employment prospects and higher standards of living, creating a magnet for rural populations and smaller towns, leading to rapid urban expansion. Economic opportunity fuels their growth. Investing in public transportation, promoting green building practices, implementing smart city technologies, and prioritizing the needs of marginalized communities are crucial steps towards creating more livable and resilient megacities.

The future of urbanization is linked to megacities. Managing these complex systems will only increase in importance. Embracing sustainable practices and prioritizing well-being can make megacities thriving centers. Otherwise unsustainable sprawl, environmental degradation, and social inequality are a scenario to avoid.

Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, involves performing activities while asleep. Research suggests it is caused by genetics, development, and triggers. It is often associated with the immaturity of the central nervous system. During sleepwalking episodes, the brain exhibits sleep and wakefulness patterns.
