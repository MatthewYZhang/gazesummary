The Maya civilization flourished for centuries, leaving behind impressive achievements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. However, their story is one of growth, innovation, and societal collapse. The Early Preclassic period marked the emergence of the Maya, with the development of agricultural practices and settled communities. The Middle Preclassic period saw population growth and the adoption of complex agricultural techniques, as well as the construction of monumental architecture. The Late Preclassic period was a time of consolidation and innovation, with the development of the Maya writing system and Long Count calendars. The first true Maya cities arose, serving as centers of political, religious, and economic power.

The Classic Period is considered the golden age of the Maya civilization. During this time, Maya cities reached their peak in size and splendor, with prominent city-states like Tikal, Palenque, Copán, and Calakmul. These cities were centers of art, learning, and commerce, and they engaged in both alliances and conflicts with one another. Maya artists produced exquisite sculptures, intricate murals, and elaborate pottery, and Maya scribes recorded historical events, religious beliefs, and astronomical observations. This period saw an explosion of intellectual and artistic activity, leaving a legacy of cultural achievements that continues to inspire awe.

However, the Classic Period also marked the beginning of the Maya decline, with cities experiencing political instability, warfare, and population decline. The reasons for the Maya collapse are complex and still debated by scholars, with possible factors including overpopulation, environmental degradation, drought, warfare, and social unrest. After the Classic Period, the Maya civilization entered a period of decline known as the Postclassic Period. New centers of power emerged in the northern Yucatán Peninsula, such as Chichen Itza and Mayapan. In the 16th century, the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Mesoamerica, bringing an end to the independent Maya civilization.
