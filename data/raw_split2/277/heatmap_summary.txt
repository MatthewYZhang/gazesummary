Coffee's journey from its origins as roasted beans to a global phenomenon reveals a fascinating evolution of social habits. Originating in the highlands of Ethiopia, coffee consumption was initially used in religious rituals as a stimulant. The Sufi monasteries of Yemen were among the first to cultivate and popularize coffee, spreading it across the Arabian Peninsula. By the 16th century, coffee houses emerged as social centers in cities like Cairo and Istanbul, fostering intellectual discourse. The introduction of coffee to Europe marked a turning point, gaining popularity among the educated elite and merchant classes. The demand for coffee in Europe led to coffee plantations in colonies, impacting the global trade system. The rise of instant coffee in the 20th century has transformed coffee into a readily available commodity, but the emergence of "third wave" coffee culture emphasizes quality and ethical sourcing. Coffee has become a symbol of global interconnectedness, shaping social interactions.
