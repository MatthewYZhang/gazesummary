Coffee's journey, beginning in Ethiopia, has transformed it into a global phenomenon reflecting social habits and technological advancements. Evidence suggests coffee consumption began in the 15th century in Yemen's Sufi monasteries where it was used to aid religious rituals. It spread quickly to Mecca, Medina, and Cairo by the early 16th century, leading to the emergence of "qahveh khaneh" as social and intellectual hubs.

Coffee's popularity soared in Europe by the 17th century, with coffee houses becoming vital social hubs and "penny universities" in cities like London, Paris, and Vienna. The 20th and 21st centuries further globalized coffee culture with the rise of multinational corporations and specialty coffee. There's been growing interest in ethically sourced beans and artisanal roasting, leading to independent coffee shops. Coffee shops serve as workplaces and community hubs, reflecting modern society's needs. The future of coffee is likely shaped by technological advancements and sustainability concerns, with consumers seeking ethically sourced coffee.
