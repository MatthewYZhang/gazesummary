The late medieval period marked a significant shift in warfare, propelled by technological innovations. Before the 14th century, heavily armored knights dominated European warfare, but their dominance began to wane due to the rise of effective infantry tactics. The battles of Courtrai and Crecy demonstrated the vulnerability of mounted knights against well-disciplined infantry formations. Polearms effectively negated the mobility and impact of cavalry charges. The English longbow proved devastatingly effective. The introduction of gunpowder weaponry, particularly cannons, was another critical development. These cannons quickly breached fortifications, as shown during the siege of Constantinople in 1453. Hand-held firearms also emerged, offering infantry a new means of engaging the enemy. The shift towards technologically driven warfare had significant consequences, leading to a greater centralization of power in the hands of monarchs and states and the decline of the feudal system.
