Birds are masters of the skies, achieving complex maneuvers and long-distance migrations through the interplay of physical principles and unique anatomical adaptations, including the forces of lift, drag, thrust, and weight.

Lift, the upward force that opposes gravity, is primarily generated by the shape of bird's wings, designed as airfoils. Air travels a longer distance over the curved upper surface, resulting in faster airflow and lower air pressure, while slower airflow beneath the wing creates higher pressure. This pressure difference generates lift, counteracting the bird's weight. The angle of attack, also influences lift.

Drag opposes motion through the air, including form drag and induced drag. Form drag is caused by the bird's shape, while induced drag is generated by lift. Birds also control their flight by adjusting their wings and tails and achieve remarkable maneuvers. Bird flight is a feat of engineering, showcasing the power of evolution.
