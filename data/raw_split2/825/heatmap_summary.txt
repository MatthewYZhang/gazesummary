Before the 1980s, American beer culture was dominated by national breweries producing mass-market lagers with limited variety, but a quiet revolution was brewing as consumers desired more diverse and flavorful beer options, leading to the microbrewery boom. Small-scale breweries, often run by passionate homebrewers, emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, experimenting with traditional brewing styles and new flavors, but they faced restrictive regulations and limited access to capital. The commitment to quality and innovation resonated with beer drinkers tired of the status quo. Anchor Brewing Company, revived in 1965, helped to introduce a new level of complexity and character to American beer. The term "microbrewery" evolved into "craft brewery." Major breweries have been forced to respond to the growing demand for craft beer. Craft breweries have fostered a sense of community and innovation. Despite challenges, craft breweries are likely to remain a vital force in American beer culture.
