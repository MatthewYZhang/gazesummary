The discovery of penicillin in 1928 revolutionized medicine. Antibiotics quickly became widespread, saving countless lives. However, their success led to the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bacteria evolve; some possess genetic mutations to survive antibiotics, passing resistance genes to future generations, making antibiotics ineffective. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics in human medicine for viral infections and in agriculture to promote growth in livestock drive this resistance. These resistant bacteria can spread to humans through the food chain or direct contact with animals.

The development of multi-drug resistant bacteria, or "superbugs," is concerning. They are resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, leaving few treatment options. Infections caused by superbugs lead to prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and higher death risk. Examples include MRSA and CRE. Researchers aim to combat resistance by developing new antibiotics and improving antibiotic stewardship. Scientists also explore alternative strategies, such as bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, and vaccines. Antibiotic resistance requires a coordinated effort from healthcare professionals, researchers, policymakers, and the public. Addressing the rise of antibiotic resistance is critical to safeguarding public health.
