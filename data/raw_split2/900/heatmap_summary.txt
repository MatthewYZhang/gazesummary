Before containerization, global trade was cumbersome and inefficient, with goods loaded and unloaded piece by piece, leading to damage and theft. This break-bulk system was labor-intensive and costly. Containerization revolutionized global trade by standardizing transport with sealed containers, enabling easy transfer between ships, trains, and trucks, and minimizing handling. Malcolm McLean pioneered containerization after getting frustrated with break-bulk shipping. He adapted ships to carry containers, marking the beginning of a container revolution. Initially, adoption faced resistance, but economic advantages led to gradual adaptation of ports and infrastructure. Containerization has significantly reduced transportation costs, allowing businesses to expand markets and improve supply chains, but has also resulted in job losses and environmental consequences. Efforts are underway to address the environmental challenges associated with containerization.
