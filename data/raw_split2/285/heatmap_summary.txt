The Anasazi, or Ancestral Puebloans, were an ancient Native American culture flourishing in the Four Corners region from 750 to 1300 CE, leaving a legacy of cliff dwellings and pottery. They were skilled agriculturalists who developed techniques to cultivate crops in the arid environment, mainly corn supplemented by beans and squash, employing sophisticated irrigation systems like check dams and terraces to capture and redirect rainwater.

The Anasazi society was characterized by a communal organization centered around villages, or "pueblos," constructed from adobe bricks and stone. The construction of these complex dwellings required careful planning, skillful masonry, and a deep understanding of local geology. They began to abandon their established settlements around 1300 CE, influenced by environmental factors. The reasons for this decline are complex and multifaceted, but environmental factors appear to have played a significant role. A prolonged drought, significantly reduced crop yields and strained water resources. The study of the Anasazi provides valuable insights into the complexities of human adaptation, the fragility of ecosystems, and the enduring power of cultural resilience.
