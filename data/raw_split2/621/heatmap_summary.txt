The Amazon Rainforest is a vast expanse spanning nine South American countries, predominantly in Brazil, and plays a crucial role in regulating global climate and housing diverse life. The Amazon covers approximately 6.7 million square kilometers, containing an estimated 390 billion trees and is home to around 10% of all species on Earth, including jaguars and macaws. The Amazon River is the second-longest and has the largest water volume. It acts as a vital carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, though deforestation disrupts this balance. Furthermore, it generates its own rainfall through evapotranspiration. The Amazon faces deforestation due to agriculture, logging, and mining, leading to widespread clearing and degradation. Deforestation results in habitat loss, biodiversity decline, soil erosion, and the displacement of indigenous communities. Efforts to protect the Amazon include sustainable practices, ecotourism, and environmental regulations.
