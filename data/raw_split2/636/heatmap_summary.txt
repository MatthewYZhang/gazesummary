Sleep is a fundamental biological need crucial for survival, impacting physical and cognitive health. Undervalued and sacrificed historically, modern science highlights its role in maintaining well-being. Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive functions such as attention, concentration, and decision-making, performing cognitive tasks similar to those who are intoxicated. Sleep loss increases the risk of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and mental health disorders, while weakening the immune system. Research connects sleep disturbances to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Many factors influence the quality and duration of sleep, including age and lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and stress levels. Electronic devices before bedtime and caffeine and alcohol can disrupt sleep. Healthy habits include maintaining a regular sleep-wake schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, optimizing the sleep environment, and avoiding stimulants before bed. Prioritizing sleep is an investment in health and well-being.
