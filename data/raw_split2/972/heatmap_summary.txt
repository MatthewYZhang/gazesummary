Coral reefs, dubbed the "rainforests of the sea," are diverse ecosystems providing habitat, food, and shelter for marine life, supporting about 25% of marine species. The formation of coral reefs involves a slow process where coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate, forming skeletons that build the reef structure. Coral reefs face threats from climate change, with rising ocean temperatures causing coral bleaching. The symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that live in coral tissues are expelled due to heat stress, leading to corals turning white and becoming susceptible to disease and death. Ocean acidification, caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, also weakens coral skeletons and hinders their growth. Pollution from land-based sources, like fertilizers and pesticides, harms coral health and promotes algal blooms. Overfishing can disrupt reef ecosystems, while destructive fishing practices directly damage coral reefs. Marine protected areas can provide refuge for coral reefs, and global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote sustainable resource management, and raise awareness about the importance of these precious ecosystems.
