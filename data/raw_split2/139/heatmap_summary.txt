Mesopotamia, regarded as the cradle of civilization, encompassed artistic evolution reflecting the era's social, political, and religious changes. During the Ubaid period, the foundations of Mesopotamian art were laid with refined pottery showcasing geometric patterns. Figurines, characterized by stylized forms and exaggerated eyes, served ritualistic purposes. The Uruk period introduced elaborate artwork, monumental architecture, such as ziggurats, and realistic sculpture.

In the Early Dynastic period, independent city-states emerged with their own artistic styles. Sculpture became more refined with anatomical accuracy. The Akkadian Empire saw centralized power and artistic standardization. The collapse of the Akkadian Empire led to political fragmentation, and the Neo-Sumerian period witnessed a revival of Sumerian artistic traditions, including monumental architecture and stylized sculpture. The Old Babylonian period saw a flourishing of art and literature, and sculpture became more refined. In conclusion, Mesopotamian art, from the Ubaid period to later empires, offers insights into the beliefs, values, and achievements of its inhabitants.
