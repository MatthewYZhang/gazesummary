Coffee, a popular beverage, originated in ancient Ethiopia. One legend attributes its discovery to Kaldi, a goatherd whose goats became energetic after eating coffee berries.  Coffee's invigorating properties led to its widespread cultivation and consumption across the Arabian Peninsula, where it was used in Sufi religious practices for spiritual contemplation. Coffee soon moved into social and commercial spheres in the Arab world, with coffee houses known as "qahveh khaneh" becoming vibrant centers for social interaction, intellectual discourse, and political debate and served as gathering places for various citizens. Coffee quickly became a valuable commodity and shaped social structures. The "coffee break" is a recognized social ritual in many workplaces.  The aroma and flavors of coffee have inspired countless artists.
