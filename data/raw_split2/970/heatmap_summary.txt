Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, was the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, flourishing from 1050 to 1350 CE as a major center for the Mississippian culture. Its scale and organization have fascinated archaeologists. Cahokia's emergence coincided with maize agriculture advancements, supporting population growth and labor specialization. Located near the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers, Cahokia had access to fertile floodplains and trade networks, contributing to rapid growth and complexity. At its height, Cahokia covered six square miles with a population between 10,000 and 20,000, exceeding many European cities. Cahokia was characterized by monumental earthworks, like Monks Mound, which served as a ceremonial and political center, surrounded by other mounds. The decline, beginning in the 14th century, is debated. Environmental degradation, deforestation, intensive agriculture, soil erosion, and reduced crop yields may have contributed to its abandonment. The city's population dispersed, the Mississippian culture continued, and Cahokia remains an important archaeological site.
