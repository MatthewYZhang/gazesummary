The function of sleep is a mystery, although research has identified physiological and cognitive processes associated with it. The universality of sleep suggests its critical importance. One prominent theory suggests sleep's role in neural plasticity and memory consolidation. During wakefulness, the brain is filled with information. Sleep allows the brain to process, prioritize, and effectively store this information. Studies show that specific brain regions, like the hippocampus, have heightened activity during sleep after learning tasks. Sleep helps transfer acquired information from the hippocampus to long-term storage. Sleep deprivation leads to cognitive impairment, especially with attention, memory, and decision-making. Sleep also serves a critical restorative function for the body and brain, clearing metabolic waste products via the glymphatic system. Furthermore, sleep is associated with the release of growth hormone and enhances immune function. Sleep also plays a significant role in regulating mood and emotions and it may help process and regulate emotional experiences. Researchers also investigate sleep to optimize synaptic plasticity.
