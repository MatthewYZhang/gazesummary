Container shipping has revolutionized global trade by standardizing cargo handling. Before the mid-20th century, manual loading and unloading caused delays, damage, and high costs, significantly hampering international commerce. Malcolm McLean pioneered the shipping container in the 1950s, envisioning standard-sized boxes transported seamlessly across land and sea. This concept of intermodal transportation, utilizing standardized containers, promised significant efficiency gains.

The standardization of container sizes, primarily 20-foot and 40-foot equivalents (TEUs), further streamlined the process, allowing for seamless transfer between different modes of transport. The economic impact of containerization has been profound, resulting in cost savings for businesses and consumers. Ports are investing in automation and infrastructure upgrades to improve efficiency and reduce congestion. The shipping industry is exploring alternative fuels, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen. Container shipping continues to evolve, driven by technological advancements and the changing needs of global trade.
