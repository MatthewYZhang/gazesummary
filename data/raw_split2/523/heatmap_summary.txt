Around 1,000 years ago, a remarkable civilization flourished in the Mississippi River valley, near present-day St. Louis, Missouri. These Native American peoples, known as the Mississippian culture, built a sophisticated society centered around a massive urban complex called Cahokia, which stands as the largest and most influential Mississippian settlement. Cahokia's defining feature was its monumental earthworks, most notably Monks Mound, a colossal platform mound covering 14 acres and rising 100 feet high. This mound served as the central ceremonial and residential platform for Cahokia's rulers. In addition to Monks Mound, Cahokia boasted over 120 other earthen mounds, varying in size and shape, which served as platforms for homes, temples, and other important structures. Despite its impressive achievements, Cahokia's prosperity was relatively short-lived. Around A.D. 1300, the city began to decline, with a decrease in population, a cessation of mound construction, and evidence of social unrest. The decline of Cahokia represents a significant turning point in the history of the Mississippian culture. The legacy of Cahokia serves as a reminder of the ingenuity and resilience of Native American societies, as well as the fragility of even the most advanced civilizations.
