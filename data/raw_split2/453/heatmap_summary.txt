Cuneiform emerged in Mesopotamia around the late fourth millennium BCE, linked to complex societies and the need for record-keeping. Evolving from pictographic symbols for administrative purposes, these pictographs initially represented concrete objects, inscribed on clay tablets with a reed stylus. A shift from representing objects to representing sounds, achieved through rebus writing, allowed scribes to represent abstract concepts, proper names, and grammatical elements. The standardization of wedge-shaped strokes, made with a triangular stylus, sped up the writing process. Cuneiform was used for administration, laws, and communication, as well as religious texts, literary works, and private correspondence, like the Epic of Gilgamesh. The script spread beyond Mesopotamia, adapted by cultures including the Akkadians and Babylonians. Cuneiform was eventually replaced by alphabetic systems, its secrets lost until the 19th century discovery of the Behistun Inscription, which unlocked the code to decipher the vast Mesopotamian texts. The printing press also played a crucial role in the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution.
