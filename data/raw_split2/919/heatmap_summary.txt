The emergence of written language marked a pivotal transition in human history, enabling the permanent recording of information, the development of complex thought, and the rise of civilizations. This transformative development was not a singular event but a gradual process that unfolded independently across the world. One of the earliest forms of writing was cuneiform, developed by the Sumerians around 3200 BCE. This system employed wedge-shaped marks impressed into clay tablets, initially for administrative tasks but later expanded to encompass literature and law. In ancient Egypt, hieroglyphs emerged around the same time as cuneiform, using pictographic symbols for objects and concepts. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone was crucial in deciphering hieroglyphs. The Phoenicians then developed an alphabetic system of 22 consonants around 1200 BCE, which the Greeks adapted by adding vowels, influencing the Latin alphabet. In East Asia, the Chinese developed a logographic system with symbols representing words or morphemes. The invention of the printing press revolutionized the dissemination of written information and increased literacy and knowledge.
