Every year, numerous animals undertake remarkable migrations across vast distances, exemplified by the Monarch butterfly's multi-generational trek and the Arctic tern's pole-to-pole flight. These migrations raise the question of how animals with small brains navigate so precisely. The answer involves a blend of innate abilities, learned behaviors, and environmental cues. Migration is an adaptation to changing environmental conditions, allowing animals to access resources, avoid harsh weather, or find breeding grounds. Animals navigate using a magnetic sense, detecting the Earth's magnetic field as an internal compass. Birds have specialized cells in their eyes to detect magnetic fields. Sea turtles use magnetoreception for orientation, instinctively determining the direction to the open sea.

Animals rely on cues like the sun, stars, and visual landmarks. The position of the sun and stars can be used for navigation, and visual landmarks like mountains, rivers, and coastlines can also be used to guide their way. Animals also use chemical cues, particularly salmon, navigating back to natal streams using "smellscapes." Human activities disrupt animal migrations through habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. It is crucial to understand animal migration and minimize human impact.

Botanical illustration, the art of depicting plants with scientific accuracy, serves as a bridge between science and art. These illustrations are detailed records of plant morphology and are used in education. The Renaissance marked a turning point, with artists producing detailed studies. Watercolor is a commonly used medium for botanical illustration.
