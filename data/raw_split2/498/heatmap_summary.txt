Between 800 and 1400 CE, a remarkable civilization thrived in the Mississippi River floodplain. This Mississippian culture reached its peak in Cahokia, a sprawling urban center larger than London for a time. Understanding Cahokia's rise and fall offers insight into pre-Columbian societies.

Cahokia's success stemmed from agricultural prowess, as Mississippians cultivated maize, beans, and squash for a reliable food supply. The agricultural surplus fueled population growth and a complex social structure. Cahokia stood as a highly organized urban center, with distinct social classes and specialized labor. The city contained monumental earthworks, including Monk's Mound, serving as foundations for temples and elite residences, and reflecting complex labor and organizational skills. Cahokia was a center for trade and religious activity, indicated by the discovery of shell beads and copper artifacts. The presence of elaborate burials with human sacrifices suggests a complex belief system.

Ultimately, Cahokia was eventually abandoned. Environmental factors, social dynamics, and external pressures shaped the metropolis's fate.
