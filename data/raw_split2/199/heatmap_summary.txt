The Maya civilization, which thrived for over 3,000 years in present-day Mexico and Central America, is renowned for its sophistication. Long before the arrival of Europeans, the Maya developed a sophisticated writing system, advanced mathematical concepts, and a profound understanding of astronomy. The Preclassic period saw the development of agriculture, villages, pottery, and religious practices.  During this time, they began constructing monumental architecture, and trade networks expanded.

The Classic period witnessed the zenith of Maya civilization, with the rise of city-states like Tikal and Palenque, each ruled by a king who claimed divine authority. These city-states engaged in complex political alliances, rivalries, and warfare. The Maya also developed a hieroglyphic writing system and a complex calendar system based on astronomical observations. Around the 9th century AD, the Classic Maya civilization experienced a dramatic decline, and the population shifted to the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The Postclassic period saw the rise of new Maya city-states and the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century marked the end of Maya independence. The Maya people survived, and their culture continues to thrive in many parts of Mexico and Central America today.
