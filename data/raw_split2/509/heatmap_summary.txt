The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked the rise of mass media, shifting information and entertainment dissemination from localized and interpersonal communication to a new landscape of mass communication. Key to this transformation was the development of new printing technologies, like the rotary printing press and linotype machine, enabling rapid and cost-effective production of newspapers and magazines. Coupled with railway expansion, printed materials were efficiently distributed across wider geographic areas, making newspapers more affordable and fostering a sense of shared identity. Newspapers became more affordable and accessible to a larger segment of the population, fostering a sense of shared identity and national consciousness.

Beyond print, the telegraph and telephone revolutionized communication speeds, breaking down geographical barriers and connecting distant communities. Photography and motion pictures introduced new visual media, with motion pictures offering a dynamic entertainment experience. Radio broadcasting emerged in the early 20th century, transmitting audio wirelessly to mass audiences and fostering national unity. Mass media also played a crucial role in shaping public opinion and promoting social change.
