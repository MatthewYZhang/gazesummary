Dams serve multiple purposes, but their presence can significantly impact river ecosystems. A notable consequence of dam construction involves changes in the natural flow, causing reductions in peak flows during floods and increased base flows in dry periods, disturbing cycles riverine species rely on for spawning and dispersal. The decline in peak flows can result in sediment accumulating behind the dam, which limits downstream sediment necessary to maintain channel and riparian habitats.

Additionally, dams act as barriers to fish migration, preventing them from reaching habitats crucial for reproduction. While fish ladders and other structures can help, their effectiveness varies. Dams can alter habitat availability and quality by transforming free-flowing rivers to lentic environments.

Furthermore, there has been an increasing awareness of the ecological costs associated with dams, and efforts are being made to mitigate their effects. These include dam removal to restore natural flow patterns, improve water quality, and reconnect fragmented habitats.
