The biannual journeys of birds have captivated cultures worldwide, leading to theories ranging from hibernation to transformation into other species. One key question is how birds navigate vast distances. Birds use multiple navigational cues, including an innate magnetic compass, the sun and stars, and olfactory cues. Migration has a cost, with migratory birds facing habitat loss, climate change, and collisions with structures. Researchers are studying bird migration using radio telemetry and isotope analysis. Radio telemetry involves attaching small transmitters to birds and tracking their movements using ground-based receivers or satellites, giving insights into migration routes, stopover sites, and flight speeds. The study of bird migration informs conservation efforts and protect their habitats, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and reduce the risk of collisions with human-made structures. Hyperphagia is a state of abnormally increased appetite, and telemetry is the process of recording and transmitting data from remote sources.
