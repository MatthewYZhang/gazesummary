The Columbian Exchange, initiated by Columbus's voyages, led to widespread ecological effects, including the introduction of new species and the transfer of diseases. European colonists introduced domesticated animals like horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats to the Americas, where they thrived. However, grazing led to the degradation of native ecosystems, depleting native grasses and altering plant communities, and pigs preyed on native wildlife. The Columbian Exchange also facilitated the accidental introduction of invasive species like weeds, insects, and pathogens, which outcompeted native species, disrupting ecological relationships, while the European crops like wheat, barley, and rice increased agricultural productivity, but their cultivation required clearing native forests and wetlands, resulting in habitat loss. The transfer of diseases such as smallpox, measles, and influenza decimated native populations, and the demographic collapse had profound ecological consequences. Ultimately, the Columbian Exchange resulted in habitat loss, biodiversity decline, and water resource degradation, highlighting the need for sustainable land management.
