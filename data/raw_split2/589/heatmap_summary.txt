The evolution of flight in birds, perhaps the most well-studied, involves a complex interplay of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations developed over millions of years. Birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs. The development of feathers was crucial for flight, providing insulation, display, and generating lift and thrust. The feather structure, with interlocking barbs and barbules, creates a lightweight, strong surface ideal for aerodynamic control. Birds have a unique lightweight and strong skeletal structure, with hollow and pneumatized bones, a fused clavicle (wishbone) for shoulder girdle strength, and a keeled sternum (breastbone) for flight muscle attachment. Two main muscles are responsible for flapping flight: the pectoralis major (downstroke) and the supracoracoideus (upstroke). The evolution of flight has profoundly impacted bird ecology and distribution, allowing them to diversify into various habitats, migrate long distances, exploit resources, and escape predators. The supracoracoideus is smaller and it attaches to the humerus via a tendon that passes through a pulley-like structure in the shoulder girdle. Its contraction pulls the wing upward, generating the recovery stroke. Flight has also influenced bird social behavior and communication.
