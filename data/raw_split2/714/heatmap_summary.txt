Jazz, a uniquely American art form, has roots in late 19th and early 20th-century New Orleans, blending African rhythms, European harmonies, and Creole melodies. Early jazz, or "Dixieland," used small ensembles featuring trumpet, clarinet, trombone, piano, bass, and drums, and was characterized by collective improvisation. The trumpet often carried the melody with clarinet and trombone providing embellishments. Louis Armstrong was instrumental in popularizing jazz through his improvisational skills.

As jazz spread to cities like Chicago and New York in the 1920s, it transformed into the "Swing Era", with larger ensembles led by figures like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman, emphasizing arrangements and danceable rhythms, and introducing the saxophone. After World War II, jazz branched into styles such as "Bebop", which had complex harmonies, rapid tempos and intricate improvisations. The 20th century saw further subgenres, including "Cool Jazz" and "Free Jazz". Despite its changes, jazz maintains improvisation, syncopation, and emotional expression, also serving as a force for social change. Jazz continues to evolve, inspire, and captivate.
