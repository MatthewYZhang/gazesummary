Coral reefs, dubbed the "rainforests of the sea," are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems, built by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps, secreting calcium carbonate skeletons over millennia. These reefs are vulnerable to environmental change. The earliest reefs emerged during the Triassic period, around 240 million years ago, after the Permian-Triassic extinction event, formed by now-extinct coral species and differed from modern reefs. During the Jurassic period, scleractinian corals dominated reef ecosystems. Reef distribution is shaped by temperature, light, salinity, and nutrient levels, thriving in warm, shallow, clear waters near the equator, where sunlight fuels symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which provide essential nutrients. Over geological time, reefs have responded to changes in sea level and ocean chemistry. Modern reefs face challenges from climate change, rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel symbiotic algae, and ocean acidification hinders coral growth. Despite these challenges, coral reefs exhibit remarkable resilience and adaptability. The future of coral reefs hinges on climate change mitigation and reducing human impacts. The reef is an important hub for marine life.
