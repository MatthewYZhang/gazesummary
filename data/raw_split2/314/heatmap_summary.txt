The development of agriculture in the Andes arose independently across a diverse landscape, involving the domestication of unique plants and animals adapted to high altitudes and variable rainfall. Archaeological evidence reveals early experimentation with wild plants in the highlands, beginning around 8000 BCE. Inhabitants gradually selected desirable traits, leading to cultivated forms. Key crops like potatoes, quinoa, and beans were independently domesticated in different regions, and their genetic diversity reflects this decentralized process. One of the important developments was the domestication of potatoes around 6000 BCE, which became a staple food due to their resilience at high altitudes.

Animal domestication played a crucial role. Llamas and alpacas were domesticated and used as pack animals and for their wool, with their dung used as fertilizer. Environmental challenges led to unique practices like terracing and irrigation systems. Andean agriculture faced challenges like climate change and soil degradation. Andean farmers responded with adaptive strategies, and it is essential to support them to ensure the long-term food security and environmental health of the region.
