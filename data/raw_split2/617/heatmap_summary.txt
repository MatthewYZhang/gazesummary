Coral reefs, recognized as vital ecosystems, are threatened by human activities and climate change. They support a vast array of marine species, provide food and shelter, and contribute to the ocean's biodiversity. Many fish found on reefs serve as important food sources for humans, bolstering food security in coastal regions. Additionally, reefs function as natural barriers, safeguarding coastlines from erosion and storms by absorbing wave energy.

Coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats, with climate change being a major driver of degradation, causing coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures. During bleaching, corals expel symbiotic algae, turning white and weakening. Ocean acidification further hinders corals' ability to build skeletons. Pollution from land-based sources, such as runoff and sewage, also harms coral reefs, triggering algal blooms and introducing toxins. Destructive fishing practices like dynamite fishing damage reefs, and overfishing disrupts food webs.

Conservation efforts are essential, including reducing emissions, implementing sustainable practices, and creating marine protected areas. Raising awareness and understanding of the importance of coral reefs is crucial for fostering stewardship and responsible behavior to protect them for future generations.
