Artificial light at night (ALAN) has significantly altered the natural world and presents a significant challenge to wildlife across diverse ecosystems. ALAN disrupts fundamental processes like navigation, foraging, reproduction, and predator avoidance. One well-documented effect is its impact on migratory birds, disorienting them and causing collisions with buildings, with millions of birds dying each year. ALAN can also disrupt their circadian rhythms, affecting foraging and reproduction.

Sea turtles are also affected; artificial lights near nesting sites can disorient hatchlings, causing them to crawl inland instead of towards the ocean. This reduces the number of hatchlings that reach the sea and deters adult females from nesting on brightly lit beaches.

ALAN disrupts behavior and physiology in aquatic ecosystems. It can alter feeding patterns, reproductive cycles, and predator-prey interactions. In terrestrial insects, artificial light can trap or exhaust moths and interfere with firefly signaling, making it difficult for them to find partners.

Addressing ALAN requires technological solutions, policy changes, and public awareness campaigns. Shielded lighting, timers, motion sensors, and dark sky ordinances can help. Educating the public can encourage individuals to reduce their light footprint.
