The origins of writing are believed to be rooted in record-keeping and symbolic representation. Humans began relying on mnemonic devices, pictographic symbols, and a gradual process of abstraction and standardization. Pictograms evolved into more simplified forms, known as ideograms, which were able to represent more abstract concepts. 

The major advancement was the invention of the alphabet, which represents individual phonemes. The Phoenician alphabet was a system of 22 consonant letters without vowels. This system spread throughout the Mediterranean and influenced the development of alphabets in Greece, Rome, and Europe. This was a system that was easy to learn, and therefore it made literacy accessible to a wider segment of the population, which led to the spread of ideas and literature. The cultures eventually adapted and modified alphabets with new letters and different writing conventions, which is still continuing today with the development of new technologies and forms of communication.
