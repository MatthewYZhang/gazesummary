Once a keystone species in eastern North American forests, the American chestnut (*Castanea dentata*) comprised up to 25% of the trees. Towering giants that provided a crucial food source and valued rot-resistant timber, the majestic tree was nearly driven to extinction by an imported fungal blight in the early 20th century.

The blight, caused by the fungus *Cryphonectria parasitica*, was first discovered in North America around 1904, likely introduced on imported Asian chestnut trees that exhibit some resistance. The blight quickly spread, girdling the trees and disrupting nutrient and water flow.

Efforts to restore the chestnut have been ongoing, including hybridization (crossing with blight-resistant Asian species) and genetic engineering. Backcrossing involves repeatedly crossing the hybrid offspring back with American chestnuts to retain the desirable traits while incorporating blight resistance. The hope is that one day, this iconic tree will thrive in the forests of eastern North America.
