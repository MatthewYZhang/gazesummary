Deep-sea vents, also known as hydrothermal vents, are geological formations in volcanically active areas of the ocean floor, and are essentially fissures releasing geothermally heated water. These vents, often near mid-ocean ridges, are ecosystems where life thrives despite the absence of sunlight and immense pressure.

The heated water from these vents is rich in dissolved chemicals, including hydrogen sulfide, methane, and metals, reaching temperatures from 10°C to 400°C. When the superheated vent fluid mixes with cold, oxygen-rich seawater, a chemical reaction forms a 'plume' of minerals that precipitates, creating chimney-like structures called black smokers or white smokers.

These vents support unique ecosystems based on chemosynthesis, where bacteria use the chemical energy from dissolved minerals to produce organic compounds. This forms the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms adapted to the harsh environment. Deep-sea vents influence the chemistry of the oceans, contribute to the Earth's heat budget, and may play a role in ore deposit formation, making their protection crucial.
