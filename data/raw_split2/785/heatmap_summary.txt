The Maya civilization, which flourished in Mesoamerica, presents a case study in societal development and decline. Their achievements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture contrast with their eventual abandonment of urban centers. The Classic Period, from 250-900 CE, marked the zenith of Mayan civilization. Numerous independent city-states arose, each ruled by a king who claimed divine descent. These city-states engaged in political maneuvering, alliances, and warfare. The Mayan economy was agricultural, focused on maize, beans, squash, and other crops. They developed intricate irrigation systems and terracing techniques to maximize agricultural productivity, which allowed for the development of specialized labor, including artisans, scribes, priests, and warriors.

Around the 9th century CE, the Classic Maya civilization experienced a dramatic decline as major city-states were abandoned, and their populations dispersed. Factors such as environmental degradation, deforestation, soil erosion, and drought likely undermined agricultural productivity and created food shortages. Population growth strained resources and exacerbated environmental problems. Increased warfare between city-states disrupted trade, weakened political stability, and diverted resources. While the Classic Maya civilization collapsed, the Maya people did not disappear, and their culture has endured to this day.
