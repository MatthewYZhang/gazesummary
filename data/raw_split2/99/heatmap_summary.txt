The Cambrian period, spanning roughly 541 to 485.4 million years ago, is a pivotal chapter in Earth's history, marked by an unprecedented surge in the diversity of life. This period, known as the "Cambrian explosion," witnessed the rapid appearance of most major animal phyla. Prior to the Cambrian, life was dominated by single-celled organisms and simple multicellular creatures, collectively known as the Ediacaran biota, which left behind enigmatic fossils that are difficult to classify. The transition from the Ediacaran to the Cambrian is abrupt, with a significant increase in the number and variety of fossils found in Cambrian-aged rocks.

The Cambrian explosion is characterized by the appearance of animals with skeletons, shells, and other hard body parts. These new features allowed for the preservation of more complete and detailed fossils, providing a clearer picture of Cambrian life. Fossils from this period reveal a wide range of body plans. The causes of the Cambrian explosion are a subject of ongoing scientific debate.
