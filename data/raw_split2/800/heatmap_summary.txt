The rise of remote work, performing job duties outside a traditional office, has gained popularity recently, marking a significant shift in the modern workplace, fueled by technological advancements. The concept can be traced to the late 20th century, with the advent of computers and the internet enabling tasks from home. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated the adoption of remote work. The shift can improve job satisfaction and promote inclusivity for those with disabilities.

However, challenges remain, including the need for investment in technology infrastructure and the implementation of effective performance management. Maintaining team cohesion is also a difficulty. Looking ahead, hybrid models are likely to characterize the future of remote work, offering benefits for both employers and employees, provided that innovation is embraced, investments in technology are made, and trust and collaboration are fostered.
