The Cambrian Explosion, a period of unprecedented diversification of life forms, occurred approximately 541 to 485.4 million years ago and marks the appearance of major animal phyla in the fossil record. Before the Cambrian, the Ediacaran period featured soft-bodied organisms, but they lacked characteristics of modern animal phyla. The Cambrian period saw the emergence of animals with skeletons and shells, which fossilized readily, providing a more detailed fossil record.

One explanation focuses on increased oxygen levels in oceans and atmosphere during the early Cambrian, supporting energy-intensive lifestyles. Another suggests the evolution of eyes and sensory organs played a crucial role, leading to new predatory and defensive strategies. The evolution of developmental genes and ecological factors also contributed to the Cambrian Explosion. The Cambrian Explosion established basic body plans still present in modern animals. Despite research, the precise causes and mechanisms of the Cambrian Explosion remain debated.
