Sustainable agriculture seeks to counteract the negative impacts of modern farming practices, which often lead to soil degradation. Traditional methods, relying on fertilizers and pesticides, disrupt soil ecosystems. Monoculture and intensive tillage can deplete nutrients, increase vulnerability to pests, and cause erosion.

Sustainable agriculture offers alternatives like crop rotation and cover cropping to replenish nutrients, break pest cycles, and improve soil structure. Integrated pest management (IPM) focuses on preventative measures and biological controls to minimize pesticide use. Organic farming is a type of sustainable agriculture that prohibits synthetic chemicals and GMOs, relying instead on natural fertilizers and biological pest control. The transition to sustainable agriculture requires a shift in mindset and access to education, along with government support and consumer demand for sustainably produced food. By adopting a holistic approach, sustainable agriculture aims to ensure food security and create a resilient food system that benefits both people and the planet.
