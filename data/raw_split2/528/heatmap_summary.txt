Around 1050 CE, a remarkable transformation began in the fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River, near present-day St. Louis, Missouri. Indigenous peoples coalesced to create Cahokia, the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico. It flourished for centuries, before undergoing a decline and eventual abandonment by the 14th century. The reasons for its rise and fall are complex and debated by archaeologists and historians.

The success of Cahokia was deeply intertwined with its agricultural prowess, especially maize, beans, and squash, the “three sisters” of indigenous agriculture, which supported a dense population and allowed for specialization of labor. The city's skyline was dominated by Monk’s Mound and other platform mounds and burial mounds.

Starting in the 13th century, the city experienced a period of decline, marked by population decrease, social unrest, and environmental degradation. One hypothesis suggests that intensive agriculture led to soil exhaustion and deforestation. Climate change, such as prolonged droughts, also impacted agricultural yields and contributed to social stress. Defensive structures suggest that Cahokia faced increasing threats from rival communities. By the 14th century, Cahokia was largely abandoned, its inhabitants dispersing to other locations in the Mississippi River Valley. Despite its eventual abandonment, Cahokia remains a testament to the ingenuity of the Mississippian peoples.
