Before standardized musical notation, music was primarily oral, learned by ear, and passed down through generations through performance and imitation. This oral tradition fostered musical memory and improvisation, but it also made musical works vulnerable to alteration and loss. Early attempts to notate music were rudimentary. In ancient Greece, letter notation represented pitch but lacked rhythm. Other cultures used mnemonic devices like symbols or gestures to aid in remembering melodies, but they were personal and subjective. The real foundation for modern musical notation began in medieval Europe within the Catholic Church. Gregorian chant, initially transmitted orally, prompted a need for reliable notation. Guido of Arezzo refined staff usage, indicating specific pitches, standardizing the four-line staff. Guido associated syllables with notes, deriving them from a hymn, evolving into the solf√®ge system. These innovations facilitated the teaching and transmission of chant. Software like Sibelius or Finale can transcribe music instantly and allow one to notate music.
