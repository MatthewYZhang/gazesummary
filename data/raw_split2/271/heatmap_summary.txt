Urban beekeeping, a resurgence of an ancient practice, is gaining popularity in urban environments. This phenomenon involves keeping honeybee colonies in cities and suburban areas, attracting city dwellers who aim to connect with nature and support pollinators. This boom is driven by the growing awareness of honeybees' vital role in pollination, especially with declining bee populations due to habitat loss and pesticide use. Urban beekeeping can bolster local pollinator populations and contribute to food security, as cities offer diverse floral resources in parks and gardens. The practice also appeals to those interested in sustainable living and local food production, providing a way to engage with nature and produce unique, hyperlocal honey. The flavor profiles of urban honey depend on the available floral sources, making it a prized commodity. The honey harvested from urban hives can be remarkably free of contaminants, as urban bees often forage on a wider variety of floral sources than their rural counterparts, which may be exposed to agricultural pesticides.
