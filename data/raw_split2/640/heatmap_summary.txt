Jazz, originating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from New Orleans, is a distinctly American art form blending blues, ragtime, and European brass band music with improvisational elements and unique rhythms. The musicians were able to express their individuality with their own melodies and variations within a structured framework. Early jazz, like Dixieland, featured collective improvisation. Trumpets, clarinets, trombones, and banjos were prominent instruments that provided an upbeat and energetic sound that thrived in the dance halls and brothels of New Orleans. As jazz spread to cities like Chicago and New York, the Swing Era emerged, led by Duke Ellington and Count Basie, with brass, reeds, and rhythm instruments. The music became more danceable with complex arrangements. Bebop, led by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, was characterized by its rapid tempos. Cool jazz emerged later and was led by musicians like Miles Davis. Then in the 1960s, free jazz emerged, and fusion combined jazz with rock, funk, and world music. The legacy of jazz is enduring and has influenced many musicians and embodies freedom of expression.
