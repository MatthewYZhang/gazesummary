The late Pleistocene epoch saw the extinction of megafauna like woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats, a subject of ongoing debate with two leading hypotheses: climate change and human overhunting. The climate change hypothesis suggests that environmental shifts at the end of the last ice age, such as glaciers retreating and temperatures rising, significantly transformed ecosystems with forests replacing grasslands, deserts expanded, and disrupted megafauna food and habitats. The overhunting hypothesis attributes the extinction to early humans, who targeted these animals for food with the blitzkrieg model implying rapid decimation of populations by hunting pressure. The presence of spear points near mammoth bones confirms human hunting of mammoths, but other factors like disease are also mentioned as potential contributors. However, critics point out the lack of widespread overhunting evidence. A third hypothesis suggests that climate change weakened megafauna, making them more vulnerable to human hunting pressure, known as the “synergistic extinction” model. Despite research using fossil records and ancient DNA, the precise cause is still unresolved, with a combination of climate change and human activities likely being responsible, necessitating further research to unravel the mystery.
