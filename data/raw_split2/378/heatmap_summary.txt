Animal migration is a large-scale movement driven by the need for food, reproduction, or escaping harsh conditions, spanning thousands of kilometers and requiring navigational skills. Understanding it remains a challenge. Triggers are varied, with seasonal temperature and rainfall changes affecting food availability. Birds migrate north in spring for insects, returning south as it gets colder. Wildebeest migrate in a circular pattern in Serengeti, following the rains for fresh grazing. Internal biological clocks, influenced by day lengths, also contribute to the timing of migration, ensuring timely arrival for breeding or feeding.

Navigating presents a puzzle, as young, inexperienced animals find their way. Factors are involved, where some rely on celestial cues like the sun, moon, or stars, while others utilize Earth's magnetic field with specialized receptors. Landmarks, like rivers and mountains, serve as guideposts.

The study of migration is important due to environmental change, where migratory species are vulnerable. Understanding migratory routes, habitat needs, and navigational mechanisms is key for conservation. Satellite tracking and GPS loggers provide insights into movements, allowing identification of critical habitats.
