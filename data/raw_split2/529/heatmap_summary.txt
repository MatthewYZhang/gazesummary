Coffee has transformed into a global industry, influencing economies, social interactions, and artistic expression. Originating in the highlands of Ethiopia, the coffee plant's discovery is linked to a legend of a goat herder named Kaldi, who observed his goats becoming unusually energetic after consuming berries. He tried the berries himself and experienced a similar invigorating effect. From Ethiopia, coffee cultivation spread to Yemen, becoming a staple beverage and trade commodity by the 15th century. "Qahveh khaneh," or coffee houses, emerged in cities like Mecca and Cairo, serving as social hubs for intellectual discussions, storytelling, and entertainment. The future of coffee culture is likely to be shaped by sustainability, ethical sourcing, and a continued appreciation for the art and science of coffee brewing.
