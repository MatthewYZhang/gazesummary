The Roman Empire's architectural success is significantly attributed to Roman concrete, a mix of volcanic ash, lime, aggregate, and water, differing from modern concrete that relies on Portland cement. The Roman engineers' gained experience in experimenting with different mixtures and construction techniques, then began utilizing concrete for more ambitious projects. This experimentation led to key discoveries, the pozzolanic reaction, where volcanic ash reacts with lime and water, imparted strength, durability, and seawater corrosion resistance. Roman concrete could be molded into any shape using formwork, enabling architects to create complex structures like arches, vaults, and domes and facilitating masterpieces like the Pantheon. The Pantheon's dome exemplifies Roman concrete technology and innovative designs. The Pantheon dome used heavier aggregates at the base and lighter materials near the top, to minimize stress and ensure stability. Although its use declined after the Roman Empire, its legacy endures with modern researchers studying it for future materials.
