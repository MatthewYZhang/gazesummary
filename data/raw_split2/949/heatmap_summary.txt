Before the printing press, knowledge was limited to the elite, with books painstakingly copied by hand, leading to errors and limited information spread. The advent of the printing press was a pivotal moment, revolutionizing knowledge dissemination and enabling the Renaissance, Reformation, and Scientific Revolution. Early forms of printing, like woodblock printing in China, existed long before Gutenberg. Woodblock printing, with carved wood blocks inked and pressed onto paper, was used in China as early as the 7th century.

Gutenberg's innovation involved creating movable metal letters, allowing for efficient book production and wider accessibility. Books became more affordable, leading to increased literacy and intellectual ferment. The printing press played a crucial role in the Renaissance, enabling rapid dissemination of classical texts and humanist ideas. The press also facilitated the Reformation, as Martin Luther distributed his Ninety-Five Theses, challenging the Catholic Church. Scientific discoveries were widely disseminated, helping advance knowledge during the Scientific Revolution. Despite challenges like censorship, the printing press fostered freedom of expression and diverse viewpoints.
