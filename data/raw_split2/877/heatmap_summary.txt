Jazz, an American musical art form, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from the African American communities in the Southern United States. It blended African musical traditions with European harmonic structures, creating an improvisational style. New Orleans is considered the birthplace of jazz, because the social and cultural environment of the city, a melting pot of ethnicities and musical traditions, provided fertile ground for its development. The African American population, with its roots in blues, gospel, and ragtime, played a pivotal role in shaping jazz, and brass bands contributed to the instrumentation. Early jazz, called "Dixieland" or "New Orleans jazz," was characterized by collective improvisation. As jazz spread, it transformed, evolving into subgenres. In the 1920s, the "Jazz Age" flourished in cities like Chicago and New York. Jazz has remained a dynamic art form and continues to inspire musicians and listeners.
