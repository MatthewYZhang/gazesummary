Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a pervasive form of pollution that is rapidly increasing across the globe, impacting even remote ecosystems. While the benefits of artificial light are undeniable, the ecological consequences are becoming increasingly apparent.

Many organisms have evolved under natural light regimes. ALAN disrupts these natural light patterns, leading to a cascade of ecological effects. Nocturnal animals that rely on darkness for hunting or avoiding predators are disoriented by artificial light, making them more vulnerable. Studies show bats avoid brightly lit areas, reducing food access. Nocturnal insects are attracted to artificial lights, often leading to exhaustion, death, or disrupting their role as pollinators. 

The impact of ALAN is pronounced in aquatic ecosystems. Artificial light can penetrate water, affecting marine and freshwater organisms. Sea turtles are disoriented, causing them to move inland, where they are vulnerable to predators or dehydration. In coral reefs, ALAN can disrupt spawning events, reducing reproductive success and altering phytoplankton composition.

Migratory birds are also significantly affected by ALAN and are disoriented. Millions of birds die each year as a result of light pollution.

The ecological impacts of ALAN require a multifaceted approach, including reducing light pollution through shielded lights, dimmers, and timers. Ultimately, we should balance the benefits of artificial light with the need to protect ecosystems.
