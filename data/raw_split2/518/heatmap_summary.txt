Göbekli Tepe, located in southeastern Turkey, is an archaeological site that has changed our understanding of the Neolithic period and the origins of civilization. Dating back to the 10th millennium B.C., it predates pottery, metallurgy, writing, and even settled agriculture. This complex of massive, elaborately carved stone pillars remains a mystery, inviting scholarly debate and captivating the public.

The site has circular enclosures, containing T-shaped limestone pillars. The pillars, some weighing up to 16 tons, are adorned with intricate carvings of animals such as foxes, lions, vultures, snakes, and insects. No evidence of domestic occupation has been found within the enclosures, suggesting that Göbekli Tepe was not a settlement but a ritual or ceremonial center. One theory suggests Göbekli Tepe was a site of religious significance.

The deliberate burial of the enclosures is another puzzle. After a period of use, each enclosure was carefully backfilled with soil and debris. The reasons for this burial are unknown. The mystery of Göbekli Tepe is likely to endure, making it a source of fascination and debate.
