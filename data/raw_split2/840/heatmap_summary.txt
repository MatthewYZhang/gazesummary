Cahokia, a Mississippian metropolis, flourished around 1050 AD in the Mississippi River floodplains near present-day St. Louis. It was the largest and most influential city of the Mississippian culture, a complex society that thrived from 800 to 1400 AD. Cahokia was a true urban hub with a sophisticated social structure, intricate planning, and impressive monumental architecture, unlike other pre-Columbian civilizations that were simply villages.

A striking feature of Cahokia was its mounds, with over 120 earthen mounds ranging in size from small platforms to enormous pyramids. These mounds served purposes such as supporting residences and temples of elite members and marking ceremonial spaces. By the 14th century, Cahokia had largely been abandoned, and the legacy of Cahokia remains as the massive mounds stand as silent witnesses.

Archaeological research continues to uncover new insights into Cahokian society, shedding light on the rise and fall of this remarkable urban center and its place in the history of North America as a reminder of the complexity and sophistication of pre-Columbian cultures.
