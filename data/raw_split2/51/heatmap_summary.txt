Coral reefs, diverse and productive ecosystems, are built over thousands of years by coral polyps secreting calcium carbonate. They are home to about 25% of marine species. Reef formation begins with planulae settling on hard substrates in shallow, clear, warm waters. These conditions are essential for zooxanthellae to photosynthesize, providing corals with nutrients and energy in a mutualistic relationship. Coral reefs support diverse marine life, forming complex food webs, with energy flowing from algae to herbivores to carnivores.

There are three main types of coral reefs: fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls. Rising ocean temperatures due to climate change lead to coral bleaching. Pollution from land-based sources and destructive fishing practices also damage coral reefs. Conservation involves reducing emissions, regulating pollution, sustainable fishing, marine protected areas, and reef restoration. Studying coral reefs requires a multidisciplinary approach to understand complex interactions and develop effective conservation strategies.
