Before the printing press, knowledge dissemination in Europe was a laborious and costly process, as books had to be meticulously handwritten, primarily by monks and scribes, taking months or years for a single volume, making books rare and expensive, limiting access to the elite, and libraries were small, exclusive institutions with a mostly illiterate population. The demand for books grew with literacy rates. The technological breakthrough came in the mid-15th century with Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press with movable type, adapting existing technologies to mechanically reproduce texts. Gutenberg's first major project was the printing of the Bible, showcasing the precision and efficiency of the technology. News of Gutenberg's invention spread rapidly, and printing presses were established throughout Europe. The printing press dramatically reduced the cost of books, fueling the growth of literacy and facilitating the standardization of languages. It also played a crucial role in the Renaissance and the Reformation by disseminating classical texts and humanist ideas and Martin Luther's writings. The printing press made it easier to produce and distribute maps, scientific diagrams, and other visual aids, enhancing scientific understanding and exploration. Some worried that it would undermine the authority of the Church and the State, while others feared that it would lead to the spread of heresy and sedition, but the printing press transformed European society and revolutionized communication, knowledge, and culture.
