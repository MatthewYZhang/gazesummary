E-commerce has changed the retail landscape and encompasses the online buying and selling of goods and services. Unlike physical stores, e-commerce operates 24/7, serving a global customer base, and accessibility is a key driver of its growth.

One of the most significant impacts of e-commerce is its disruption of traditional retail models. Traditional stores face increased competition from online retailers who offer lower prices because they do not need to maintain storefronts, hire staff, or manage inventory. This cost advantage helps online retailers offer competitive pricing, attracting consumers. E-commerce provides a vast selection of products from diverse vendors, surpassing the limited offerings of physical stores. The rise of e-commerce has also influenced the physical landscape of cities and towns.

Moreover, the constant flow of data generated by e-commerce platforms offers insights into consumer behavior, enabling businesses to personalize marketing campaigns and optimize product offerings. Pollutants are carried to town, where they tend to concentrate.
