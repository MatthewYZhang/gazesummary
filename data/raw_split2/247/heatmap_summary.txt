The transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agricultural communities marks a pivotal point, known as the Neolithic Revolution, which unfolded independently across various regions due to environmental changes, population pressures, and innovations. Understanding this shift requires moving beyond traditional narratives focused on male roles and appreciating women's contributions.

Recent research highlights the critical role of women in early agriculture. Women's intimate knowledge of plant life cycles and medicinal uses, gained from gathering plant foods, likely formed the basis for agricultural practices. With settled lifestyles, the need for organized labor and cooperation arose. Women played a central role in early agricultural societies, contributing to food production and economic stability. The adoption of agriculture led to population growth and larger families. Women managed households, raised children, and contributed to the community's well-being. The increased demands of child-rearing led to a division of labor, with women focusing on domestic tasks and childcare. The development of agriculture also led to fertility cults and goddess worship, reflecting the importance of female reproductive capacity.
