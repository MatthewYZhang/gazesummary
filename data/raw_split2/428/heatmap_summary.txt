Bird migration, the seasonal movement of birds between breeding and non-breeding areas, is a remarkable phenomenon. The reasons and mechanisms behind this complex behavior are still being unraveled. A primary driver for migration is food availability, with birds moving to areas where resources are abundant during specific seasons. Birds navigate with remarkable accuracy, often traveling thousands of kilometers. They rely on navigational cues such as the Earth's magnetic field, the sun and stars, and polarized light to orient themselves. Experiments show that birds have specialized cells with magnetite crystals to detect the Earth's magnetic field. While the energetic costs of migration are substantial, birds minimize expenditure through strategies like soaring, gliding, and flocking. The evolutionary origins of migration are debated, with hypotheses suggesting it evolved to exploit seasonal resources or as a response to glaciation. Migration faces threats from habitat loss, climate change, and human-made structures, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.
