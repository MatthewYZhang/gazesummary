The development of social behavior in primates, including humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs, involves the interplay of genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and learned behaviors. Primate infants, unlike many other mammals, experience an extended period of dependency on their mothers (or other caregivers) for nourishment, protection, and social learning. This dependency provides opportunities for young primates to learn social rules and nuances by observing and interacting with their social group.

Primates that are reintroduced into the wild must be given opportunities to learn social skills from experienced wild primates in order to successfully integrate into their new social environment. Communication is essential for successful social interaction in primates. Primates use a variety of communication signals, including vocalizations, facial expressions, body postures, and gestures.
