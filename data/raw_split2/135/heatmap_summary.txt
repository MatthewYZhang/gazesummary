Impressionism, emerging in the late 19th century, reacted against the French Academy's rigid academic styles. The Impressionists sought to capture fleeting, subjective impressions of scenes or objects, focusing on light, atmosphere, and color with loose brushstrokes and vibrant palettes. The movement's origins trace back to the Salon des Refusés of 1863, with artists like Édouard Manet challenging artistic norms. The true birth of Impressionism is attributed to the 1870s, with artists like Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, and Camille Pissarro exhibiting together independently. Monet's "Impression, soleil levant" gave the movement its name, and critics initially dismissed it as a mere "impression." The artists embraced the label. Impressionist painters often depicted scenes of modern life, rejecting historical and mythological subjects, and emphasizing subjective perception. 

In the mid-15th century, Gutenberg's invention of printing with movable type marked a turning point in human history. Before this, handwritten books were expensive and accessible to few. Gutenberg's key innovation was the development of movable type: individual pieces of metal that could be arranged to form words and sentences. The printing revolution fostered literacy and scientific advancement.
