The Neolithic Revolution involved a shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture, beginning around 10,000 BCE. This included the domestication of plants and animals, and the adoption of sedentary lifestyles. Hunter-gatherer societies were typically nomadic or semi-nomadic, following food resources and allowing for the regeneration of plant and animal populations. Labor was generally divided along gender lines. Several factors, including population pressure and climate change, contributed to the development of agriculture. Specifically, a warmer climate favored the growth of plants, and certain regions had richer species for domestication, such as the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East. Sedentary lifestyles led to the development of villages and cities, and the surplus of food led to a more complex social hierarchy and political structures. Early human migrations began with *Homo erectus* around 1.8 million years ago, driven by the search for food. The *Homo sapiens* dispersed from Africa around 70,000 years ago. This resulted in the colonization of continents except Antarctica.
