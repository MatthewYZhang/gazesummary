The Mayan civilization, which flourished from approximately 250 to 900 AD, collapsed around the 9th century AD. While the civilization was known for its impressive architectural achievements, intricate calendrical systems, and advanced mathematical knowledge, a dramatic and widespread collapse occurred in the southern lowlands. One prominent theory attributes the collapse to severe droughts during the terminal Classic period, which would have had a devastating impact on agriculture, leading to crop failures, famine, social unrest, and abandonment of cities. Deforestation may have exacerbated the effects of drought.

However, another perspective emphasizes internal social and political factors. The Classic Maya civilization had a complex system of competing city-states. Population growth strained resources, making the Maya more vulnerable to drought, and warfare disrupted food production and distribution. Despite the collapse in the south, the northern Maya region experienced resilience, with cities like Chichen Itza and Uxmal thriving due to different environmental conditions. The Maya civilization did not disappear entirely but underwent transformation. Future research combining archaeological, climatological, and historical data may further unravel the mystery of the Maya collapse.
