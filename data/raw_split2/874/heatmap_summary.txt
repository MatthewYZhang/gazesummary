The end of the Permian period witnessed the largest extinction event, eliminating a significant portion of marine and terrestrial species. While causes such as asteroid impacts were considered, the eruption of the Siberian Traps is a compelling explanation. These traps cover a vast area in Siberia and were formed by massive lava outpourings over an extended period. The eruptions released gases like carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, contributing to the Permian-Triassic extinction.

The release of carbon dioxide led to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and global warming, with temperatures potentially rising by 10 degrees Celsius, devastating marine and terrestrial life. Sulfur dioxide formed sulfuric acid aerosols, causing short-term cooling and acid rain. However, the long-term effects of carbon dioxide overwhelmed the short-term cooling. The eruptions may also have triggered the release of methane, amplifying the warming trend.

These combined effects created a hostile environment for life, stressing marine and terrestrial species. Honeybees face challenges from pesticides, particularly neonicotinoid insecticides, and parasitic Varroa mites, which threaten colony health. CCD is characterized by the disappearance of worker bees, with causes that are complex. Addressing these issues is vital to protecting these critical pollinators.
