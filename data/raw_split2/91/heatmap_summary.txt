Coffee has become a dominant global beverage, transforming social habits and economies. The stimulating effects of coffee beans were discovered by Kaldi, an Ethiopian goat herder. By the 15th century, coffee consumption spread through the Arabian Peninsula, where coffee houses became centers of social and intellectual activity. Coffee houses began to appear in major European cities and were nicknamed "penny universities" because, for the price of a cup of coffee, one could engage in stimulating conversations and learn about the latest news. Multinational coffee chains transformed coffee consumption into a mainstream phenomenon, emphasizing convenience, customization, and a sense of community. The "third wave" coffee movement has emerged, emphasizing quality and sustainability. Coffee has become embedded in artistic expression, inspiring artists and thinkers. Today, coffee remains a ubiquitous beverage, adapting to changing tastes and trends.
