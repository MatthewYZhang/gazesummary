The Mycenaean civilization flourished in mainland Greece during the Late Bronze Age, roughly 1600-1100 BCE, characterized by its impressive citadels, intricate artwork, and a sophisticated writing system known as Linear B. The civilization's decline around 1100 BCE remains a subject of intense scholarly debate.

Mycenaean society was structured around powerful, fortified city-states such as Mycenae, Tiryns, and Pylos, featuring massive Cyclopean walls, palaces, and sophisticated drainage systems. Linear B revealed that these palaces served as administrative centers, meticulously recording economic activities, including agricultural production.

The Mycenaeans were renowned for their maritime prowess. Their ships dominated the Aegean Sea, facilitating trade and enabling military expeditions. The "Iliad" and "Odyssey," attributed to Homer, vividly portray the Mycenaean world, depicting heroes like Agamemnon and Odysseus. Around 1200 BCE, signs of upheaval began to appear, and by 1100 BCE, the Mycenaean civilization had largely collapsed.

The collapse remains a subject of ongoing investigation, with theories including internal strife. Regardless of the specific causes, the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization had profound consequences for the course of Greek history and the legacy of the Mycenaeans lived on in the oral traditions that eventually gave rise to the "Iliad" and "Odyssey."
