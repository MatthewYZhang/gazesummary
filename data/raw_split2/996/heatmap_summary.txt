Invasive species, also known as introduced, alien, or non-native species, are organisms not indigenous to a specific location. Once introduced, they tend to spread and cause harm to the environment, human health, or the economy. Human activities have dramatically accelerated the rate and expanded the scale of species introductions, leading to significant ecological and economic consequences.

The introduction of invasive species often begins with human actions, both intentional and unintentional. Intentional introductions may involve the deliberate release of organisms for agricultural, ornamental, or recreational purposes. Certain plant species are introduced for landscaping or erosion control, while others are brought in for their potential medicinal or commercial value. Unintentional introductions occur when species are transported inadvertently as stowaways in cargo ships, airplanes, or other modes of transportation. 

Biological control involves the use of natural enemies to control invasive species.
