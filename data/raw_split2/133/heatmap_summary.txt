Wildfires, a natural component of terrestrial ecosystems, influence forest structure, composition, and function while maintaining biodiversity and nutrient cycling. The effects of a fire, however, can vary dramatically depending on fire intensity, frequency, and the characteristics of the affected forest. The immediate impact is vegetation destruction, depending on fire intensity. High-intensity fires consume vegetation, while lower-intensity fires scorch bark and burn leaf litter, leaving mature trees intact. Wildfires also impact soil properties, altering its chemical composition and physical structure, and can volatilize nutrients, reduce soil moisture, and increase erosion. They also trigger beneficial processes by promoting nutrient cycling and creating habitat diversity, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor. In contrast, fire suppression efforts, intended to protect human lives and property, have often led to the accumulation of excessive fuels in forests, increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfires.
