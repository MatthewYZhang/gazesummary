Microplastics, defined as plastic particles less than 5mm in size, have become ubiquitous pollutants in marine environments. Originating from a variety of sources, these tiny particles pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems and have raised serious concerns among scientists and environmentalists.

One of the most pressing issues is the ingestion of microplastics by marine organisms, from zooplankton to seabirds and marine mammals, with detrimental effects. Microplastics can lead to physical harm, such as blockages in the digestive tract, internal abrasions, and reduced feeding efficiency. They can also act as vectors for transporting harmful chemicals because plastics are known to adsorb persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from the surrounding environment, effectively concentrating these toxins. When ingested, these chemicals can be transferred to the organism, leading to bioaccumulation and potential health issues.

The presence of microplastics can also alter marine habitats by accumulating in sediments, affecting benthic organisms. Addressing the issue of microplastic pollution requires a multifaceted approach, including reducing the input of plastic waste, preventing the release of microplastics from specific sources, and conducting research to better understand their impacts. Research is needed to better understand the fate, transport, and impacts of microplastics in marine environments. Investing in research and innovation can mitigate the impacts of this pervasive pollutant and protect the health and integrity of marine ecosystems.
