The Cambrian explosion, a period of unprecedented evolutionary innovation roughly 541 to 485.4 million years ago, saw a remarkable array of complex, multicellular organisms emerge. The fossil record shows the sudden appearance of major animal phyla, including ancestors of arthropods, mollusks, chordates, and echinoderms, displaying diverse body plans and features like shells, skeletons, eyes, and complex behaviors.

Several hypotheses attempt to explain the Cambrian explosion, including theories emphasizing the role of environmental changes, especially a significant rise in oxygen levels in the oceans, which provided the necessary metabolic energy for larger, more active organisms and facilitated the development of collagen for complex tissues and skeletons. The evolution of hard body parts, offering protection from predators and improving fossilization potential, also contributed. 

Ecological factors, such as predation leading to an evolutionary arms race and the diversification of ecological niches, played a significant role. The Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang biota are important fossil sites that showcase the extraordinary diversity of life during the Cambrian, with the latter even providing an earlier glimpse into the Cambrian explosion. The Cambrian explosion remains a subject of intense research and debate, crucial for understanding the history of life and evolutionary innovation.
