Citizen science, also known as participatory science or volunteer monitoring, is a field that engages non-professional scientists in scientific research, fostering public engagement with research while providing scientists with access to large datasets. The internet and mobile technologies have dramatically expanded the scope and impact of citizen science projects. Benefits include collecting data across vast geographical areas and fostering scientific literacy.

Ecological monitoring projects, like bird counts, and astronomy projects engage volunteers. Public health projects rely on citizen scientists to report symptoms.

The success of citizen science projects depends on protocols, communication, and data validation. Clear protocols ensure data consistency. Effective communication between scientists and volunteers is critical. Data validation and quality control are essential. Citizen science is poised to play an important role in scientific research, advancing our understanding of the world and fostering an engaged citizenry.

Antibiotics have become a double-edged sword due to antibiotic resistance, driven by overuse and misuse. This poses a significant threat to global health. Antibiotic resistance can be combatted with approaches such as reducing the overuse of antibiotics, developing new antibiotics, improving hygiene practices, and monitoring the spread of resistance.
