The Cambrian explosion, a period of remarkable diversification in life's history that occurred approximately 541 million years ago, marks the sudden appearance of most major animal phyla and novel body plans. This unprecedented burst of evolutionary innovation is a subject of intense debate among scientists. One theory suggests that rising oxygen levels played a crucial role by supporting higher metabolic rates for complex body plans and active lifestyles, and by facilitating the formation of ozone to shield early life from ultraviolet radiation.

Ecological interactions, such as the evolution of predation, may have also driven diversification, leading to defensive structures and new ecological niches. Geological changes, like the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, could have increased marine environments and nutrient availability. Fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale reveals unique organisms with various body plans, feeding strategies, and sensory adaptations, underscoring the experimental nature of evolution during the Cambrian period. However, the precise relationships among early animal phyla remain a subject of ongoing research using molecular phylogenetics, which faces challenges due to the rapid diversification and limited data from extinct organisms. The Cambrian explosion represents a transition from simple ecosystems to the complex biosphere we see today, and understanding its causes and consequences is a major goal of evolutionary research.
