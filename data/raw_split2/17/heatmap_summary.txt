The Classic Maya civilization, known for its impressive architecture, intricate writing systems, and advanced understanding of mathematics and astronomy, flourished in Mesoamerica from around 250 to 900 AD, but experienced a significant collapse in the 9th century. Understanding the factors that contributed to this collapse remains a mystery in archaeology.

One leading hypothesis centers on environmental factors such as deforestation and soil erosion, suggesting that population growth led to unsustainable agricultural practices, ultimately resulting in famine. In response to deforestation and soil erosion, the Maya were actively attempting to mitigate the effects of drought with sophisticated water management systems. However, these measures may not have been enough, and the effects of drought would have significantly impacted agricultural yields, leading to food shortages, social instability, and the abandonment of cities. A third perspective is warfare and social unrest due to increased competition for resources. The Maya collapse was likely a complex phenomenon with multiple interacting causes.
