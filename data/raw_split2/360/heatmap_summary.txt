Citizen science, or community science, is a collaborative effort between scientists and the public, enabling data collection, analysis, and interpretation to advance scientific knowledge and engage citizens in scientific processes. Citizen science spans a range of disciplines, including astronomy, ecology, medicine, and environmental monitoring, and is facilitated by technological advances like the internet and mobile devices. It generates large datasets impossible for scientists to collect alone, such as birdwatching data in eBird and galaxy classifications in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Citizen science projects are also important in environmental monitoring, tracking air and water quality, monitoring invasive species, and assessing climate change impacts. These projects raise awareness and empower action, providing valuable data for policymakers and resource managers. Careful design, volunteer training, and data quality control are crucial for successful citizen science projects. There are challenges in maintaining long-term engagement of volunteers. Citizen science can promote scientific literacy, address global challenges, and empower individuals.
