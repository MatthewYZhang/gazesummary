The study of crowds has captivated social scientists for over a century. Early theories portrayed crowds as irrational and prone to violence, but more nuanced perspectives recognize the psychological dynamics at play when individuals coalesce into a collective. Gustave Le Bon's "group mind" concept argues that when individuals become part of a crowd, they lose their individual rationality and are subsumed by a collective consciousness, characterized by heightened suggestibility, emotional contagion, and a diminished sense of personal responsibility. Le Bon attributed these effects to anonymity, contagion, and suggestibility.

More recent research has emphasized social identity in shaping crowd behavior. When a crowd forms around a shared identity, individuals are more likely to act in ways that are consistent with the norms and values of that group. Leaders can shape the direction and intensity of crowd action, and effective leaders can channel the collective energy of a crowd towards constructive goals. The rise of digital technologies has introduced new dimensions to the study of crowds as online communities can act as virtual crowds. Understanding how these dynamics play out in the digital realm is crucial for addressing issues such as online harassment. The psychology of crowds is a complex and multifaceted field that draws on insights from various disciplines and understanding these dynamics, we can better navigate and manage public gatherings.
