Musical instruments bridge art, physics, and ingenuity, with sounds governed by acoustics. The generation of sound involves vibrating objects like strings, air columns, or solid materials. The specific properties of these vibrating elements such as length, tension, density and stiffness dictate the frequencies at which they vibrate and the pitch they produce. In stringed instruments, the frequency of vibration is related to string tension and length, explaining why tightening a guitar string raises its pitch and shorter strings produce higher notes. A vibrating string vibrates at harmonics that contribute to the instrumentâ€™s timbre. In wind instruments, the length and shape of the tube determine the resonant frequencies. In open-ended tubes, the instrument produces a full series of harmonics, while in closed-ended tubes, the instrument produces odd-numbered harmonics, resulting in a different timbre. Wind instruments use the tube itself as a resonator, amplifying the sound produced by the vibrating air column. Percussion instruments generate sound through striking, shaking, or scraping.
