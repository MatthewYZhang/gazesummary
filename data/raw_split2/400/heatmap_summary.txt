Cahokia, located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois, was the largest urban center north of Mexico and the most influential center of the Mississippian culture, which flourished from 800 to 1400 AD. Its fertile floodplains yielded plentiful harvests of maize, beans, and squash, forming the foundation of its agricultural economy. Cahokia's location at the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois Rivers provided access to abundant resources, supporting a large and growing population. By the 14th century, Cahokia had been largely abandoned, which serves as a cautionary tale about the delicate balance between human societies and the environment. The descendants of the Cahokia people scattered across the region, forming new communities. The factors contributing to Cahokia's decline include environmental degradation, climate change and social factors. Deforestation and overhunting may have strained Cahokia's food supply.
