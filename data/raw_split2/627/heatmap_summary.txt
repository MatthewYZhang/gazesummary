Vernacular architecture represents the traditional and localized way of building using readily available materials and reflecting the needs and cultural context of a community, being a significant adaptation to environmental and societal constraints. Unlike formal architectural styles, vernacular buildings evolve organically, embodying accumulated knowledge passed through generations.

Climate, as well as social and economic needs of a community, shapes vernacular architecture. For example, traditional farming communities often build dwellings adjacent to their fields, integrating agricultural practices into the design. Also, family structures and social hierarchies can affect the size and layout of homes.

The development of vernacular architecture is a continuous process of adaptation and innovation; and the underlying principles are to create buildings that are functional, sustainable, and culturally relevant. Efforts are being made to preserve and promote vernacular architecture, with architects and builders exploring ways to integrate traditional building techniques with modern technologies.
