Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, crucial for forest ecosystem health.  These common partnerships benefit both organisms, with fungi aiding plant water and nutrient absorption, and plants providing carbohydrates to the fungi. These relationships profoundly affect plant communities, nutrient cycles, and overall ecosystem stability. There are two main types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and arbuscular mycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae, common in temperate and boreal forests with pines, oaks, and beeches, form sheaths around plant roots and hyphae extending into the root cortex.  These fungi establish extensive networks, connecting trees and facilitating nutrient and carbon transfer.  These networks play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, allowing fungi to decompose organic matter and transfer nutrients to plants. Fungi also facilitate carbon transfer from plants, contributing to carbon sequestration. Studies show their role in carbon storage, which plays a vital role in mitigating climate change. Scientists are researching mycorrhizae to develop effective forest management, conservation, and restoration strategies, aiming to enhance the resilience and productivity of forests.
