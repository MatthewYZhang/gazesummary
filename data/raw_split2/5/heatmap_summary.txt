The invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century was a turning point in history, revolutionizing knowledge and laying the groundwork for the information age. Gutenberg's innovation transformed printing into a powerful tool for mass communication. Before Gutenberg, books were copied by hand, a slow, expensive, and error-prone process, making books rare and accessible only to the elite. The vast majority of the population remained illiterate, as access to written material was limited. Gutenberg combined existing technologies to create a practical printing system, developing movable type with individual letters cast from a durable metal alloy. This process, though still requiring skill, was faster and more accurate than manual copying. The printing press dramatically increased the availability of books, lowering costs and increasing accessibility to a wider segment of the population. This increased accessibility fueled a surge in literacy.
