The late nineteenth century marked a radical change in the art world, led by the Impressionists, who challenged academic norms and paved the way for modern art. They sought to capture the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, emphasizing subjective perception. The Impressionists used short, broken brushstrokes of pure, unmixed colors to achieve their artistic goals. They focused on capturing light's effects on surfaces, depicting color and tone variations throughout the day and emphasizing momentary impressions. The Impressionists, including Monet, Degas, Renoir, Pissarro, and Sisley, shared a desire to capture immediate sensations, abandoning traditional studios for *en plein air* painting to observe light and colors. They faced criticism for unfinished works and trivial subjects, but were championed by art critics and collectors. Despite initial resistance, Impressionism gained popularity due to its emphasis on individual perception, subjective experience, and the fleeting nature of modern life. Impressionism has had a profound impact on how artists see and represent the world, inspiring subsequent movements like Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.
