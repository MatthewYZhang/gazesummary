The Mississippian culture, flourishing from 800 CE to 1600 CE in the central and southeastern United States, left a legacy of sophisticated agriculture, earthworks, and social structures, exemplified by Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico. Cahokia's emergence as a major urban center was driven by abundant resources for agriculture, particularly maize, provided by its fertile floodplain location along the Mississippi River. Intensive maize agriculture supported a growing population and specialized labor, while its strategic location facilitated trade and interaction with other Mississippian groups. By the 11th century, Cahokia was a bustling metropolis. Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, preserving the remnants of this remarkable ancient city. Despite its success, Cahokia began to decline in the 13th century CE. While Cahokiaâ€™s decline marked the end of its dominance, its legacy lived on in the traditions and practices of later Native American groups. Intensive agriculture may have depleted soil nutrients, leading to decreased crop yields. The ongoing research and interpretation of Cahokia continue to shed light on the complexities of ancient societies and the challenges they faced in adapting to environmental and social changes.
