The rise of social media has changed the landscape of interpersonal communication and is now an integral part of modern life. It offers connection and information sharing, but raises questions about the quality of human interaction, which traditionally relies on face-to-face interactions, nuanced cues, and nonverbal signals.  Social media relies on text-based communication, which can lack crucial cues, even though emojis attempt to compensate for it.  There is potential for misinterpretation in online communication without contextual cues, which can lead to conflict and strained relationships. Social media can promote superficiality in relationships because of pressure to present an idealized version of oneself online, leading to inauthentic interactions. It can result in feelings of inadequacy and social comparison among users.  Social media also offers advantages in terms of interpersonal communication, facilitating connections between geographically distant individuals with common interests. It has expanded the reach of interpersonal communication beyond family and friends, enabling individuals to engage in public discourse and share ideas.  The impact of social media is complex and multifaceted, posing challenges to the quality and authenticity of human interaction, but also providing benefits in terms of connectivity.
