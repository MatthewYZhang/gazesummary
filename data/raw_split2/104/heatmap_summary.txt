Tea, originating in ancient China, is a globally cherished drink with a fascinating history intertwined with cultural practices. Its earliest consumption dates back to the Shang Dynasty (1600-1046 BCE), used primarily for medicinal purposes. Legend attributes its discovery to Emperor Shennong around 2737 BCE, who accidentally brewed a beverage when tea leaves fell into boiling water. During the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), tea evolved into a social beverage, gaining popularity among the elite and becoming a staple in monasteries. Lu Yu's "The Classic of Tea" standardized tea preparation and etiquette.

The taxation of tea by the British government in the American colonies contributed to the tensions that ultimately sparked the American Revolution, famously symbolized by the Boston Tea Party in 1773. The simple act of sharing a cup of tea fosters understanding and creates a sense of community.
