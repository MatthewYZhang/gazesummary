Urban gardening, experiencing a resurgence in the 21st century, transforms neglected spaces into flourishing greenery, encompassing community gardens and rooftop farms. This movement addresses environmental concerns and promotes social equity and economic resilience. The environmental impact of traditional agriculture drives urban gardening, as long-distance transportation contributes to carbon emissions and conventional farming relies on harmful chemicals. Urban gardens reduce transportation costs, promote biodiversity, and minimize chemical use.

Urban gardens foster social cohesion and address food insecurity, with community gardens providing opportunities for residents to connect and build a sense of collective ownership. These gardens improve access to fresh, healthy food, combating diet-related diseases and empowering individuals. Cities can create vibrant, resilient food systems by embracing innovative technologies, fostering collaboration, and prioritizing equity, which will become more critical as urban populations grow.
