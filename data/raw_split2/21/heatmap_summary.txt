Between 3300 and 1700 BCE, the Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, thrived in what is now Pakistan and northwestern India. This Bronze Age society excelled in urban planning, sophisticated infrastructure, and trade networks. In contrast to civilizations centered around rulers or religious structures, the Harappan Civilization was more egalitarian and focused on urban life. The civilization emerged from agricultural communities in the Indus River Valley, developing into complex societies with improved agricultural techniques. By 2600 BCE, major urban centers like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro emerged with meticulous planning, grid-pattern streets, brick construction, and drainage systems. The decline of the Harappan Civilization began around 1900 BCE, with climate change and environmental degradation straining resources. By 1700 BCE, urban centers were abandoned, with the population dispersing. However, their legacy lived on in later cultures.
