Writing, a system of visual symbols used to represent language, marks a crucial turning point in human history, allowing for knowledge preservation and transmission. One of the earliest forms of writing, cuneiform, emerged in Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE. It used pictograms initially, which then evolved into wedge-shaped marks impressed on clay tablets, used for recording diverse information.  Around the same time, hieroglyphic writing developed in ancient Egypt, and it retained its pictorial form to a greater extent. The Maya civilization also developed a writing system using hieroglyphs, reaching its peak during the Classic period. 

The development of alphabetic writing systems represents a significant advancement in the efficiency and accessibility of writing. The earliest known alphabet emerged in the Levant region around 1800 BCE, known as the Proto-Sinaitic script, likely influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs. It consisted of symbols representing consonant sounds. The Phoenicians adopted and adapted this alphabet, spreading it throughout the Mediterranean. The Greek alphabet, derived from the Phoenician alphabet, added vowels, making it a more complete system, and was later adopted by the Romans for the Latin alphabet.
