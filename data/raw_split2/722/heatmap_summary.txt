E-commerce, also known as electronic commerce, involves the buying and selling of goods and services through the internet. It has evolved from concepts like mail-order to the transformative advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, revolutionizing business-consumer interactions and resulting in the explosive growth of e-commerce, now a global phenomenon impacting industries like retail, finance, and entertainment.

The early stages of e-commerce faced skepticism and uncertainty due to concerns about security and limited infrastructure. However, with technological advancements and increased consumer comfort, e-commerce gained traction, spearheaded by companies like Amazon and eBay.

Online marketplaces such as Etsy and Shopify now offer platforms for independent sellers to reach global audiences without significant initial investments. These platforms provide tools and services from website design to payment processing, facilitating the growth of online sales for small businesses. Social media has also played a crucial role in promoting products and customer engagement for these businesses. Looking forward, technologies like augmented reality (AR) and blockchain are expected to further transform e-commerce. AR can allow customers to visualize furniture or try on clothes at home, and blockchain can be used to enhance security and transparency in e-commerce transactions.
