The development of Roman law was a gradual evolution over centuries, influenced by social changes, political events, and philosophical ideas. The earliest form of Roman law was unwritten customary law known as *ius civile*, which was based on tradition, religious practices, and the rulings of priestly colleges. Legal interpretation was entrusted to the *pontifices*. A major step occurred with the creation of the Twelve Tables in the 5th century BCE, a codified collection of laws publicly displayed and dealing with various aspects of Roman life. As society grew more complex, the limitations of *ius civile* led to the development of *ius gentium*, which applied to both Roman citizens and foreigners and was based on principles of natural law and reason. The *praetors* issued edicts that helped create a more flexible and adaptable legal system. The Roman Empire witnessed further refinement, with emperors issuing imperial constitutions and legal scholars producing influential commentaries. The culmination was the codification of law under Emperor Justinian in the 6th century CE, known as the *Corpus Juris Civilis*, consisting of the *Codex*, *Digest*, *Institutes*, and *Novellae*. The *Corpus Juris Civilis* had a lasting impact on Western legal traditions, influencing the development of canon law and modern legal concepts.
