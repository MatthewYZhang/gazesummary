Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, playing a vital role in forest ecosystems by aiding in nutrient cycling and plant health. These fungi colonize roots, either penetrating cells (endomycorrhizae) or forming a sheath (ectomycorrhizae), facilitating a two-way exchange where the fungus provides water and nutrients, and the plant supplies carbohydrates from photosynthesis. The benefit arises from the hyphal network created by the fungus, which effectively increases the plant's absorptive surface area and enables access to immobile nutrients like phosphorus. Ectomycorrhizae are common in temperate and boreal forests, forming a dense sheath around the root, while endomycorrhizae are prevalent in grasslands and tropical forests, penetrating the root cells to form structures called arbuscules. The establishment of these networks is influenced by environmental factors, and they can even facilitate the transfer of resources between plants, enhancing ecosystem resilience. Protecting mycorrhizal diversity is essential for forest productivity and long-term health.
