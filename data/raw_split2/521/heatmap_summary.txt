Social insects, like ants, bees, termites, and wasps, boast highly organized societies largely due to their sophisticated communication systems. Unlike solitary insects, they heavily rely on transmitting information to coordinate tasks, defend their colony, and ensure their survival. The evolution of this communication is a fascinating story of adaptation. 

Initially, social insects depended on simple tactile and chemical cues. Early ants may have communicated alarm by erratically bumping into nestmates, triggering similar reactions. Over time, these signals specialized, with chemical communication playing a pivotal role. Pheromones, chemical substances released to elicit responses, became integral to social insect life. These pheromones serve a variety of functions. Trail pheromones guide nestmates to food sources.
Visual and auditory signals are used, especially in diurnal species. The waggle dance of the honeybee is also briefly mentioned. Effective communication facilitates the division of labor and defense. Parasitic insects may mimic pheromones to exploit resources. Understanding social insect communication can help develop better robotics and computer science systems.
