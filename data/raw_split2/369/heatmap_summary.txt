Fungi play a crucial role in forest ecosystems, often unseen as they mainly exist as a network called mycelium. These fungi are fundamental for decomposition, breaking down organic matter and releasing essential nutrients back into the soil for plants. They achieve this by secreting enzymes externally to break down complex molecules like cellulose and lignin, which are major components of wood.

Many fungi also form symbiotic relationships with plant roots, known as mycorrhiza, where the fungus extends the plant's reach for water and nutrients while receiving sugars in return. Mycorrhizal networks facilitate communication between plants, allowing them to exchange resources and even send warning signals. However, not all fungi are beneficial, as some are pathogenic and can cause diseases.

The diversity of fungi in a forest ecosystem is critical for its overall health. Understanding their complex interactions is crucial for managing and conserving valuable ecosystems in the face of challenges like climate change.
