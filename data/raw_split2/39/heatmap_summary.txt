The domestication of the horse represents a pivotal moment in human history, transforming societies globally by altering transportation, agriculture, warfare, and communication. While debated, archaeological and genetic evidence offers insight into this event. Early humans hunted wild horses for meat across Eurasia, but the shift to herding marked the beginning of domestication. The Pontic-Caspian steppe region is considered the most likely location. Climate changes led to expanding grasslands, providing a suitable environment for horses, while human management and selective breeding favored docility and robustness. Horses significantly boosted agricultural production and long-distance trade. The discovery of bit wear suggests the use of horses for riding or draft purposes as early as the 4th millennium BCE. Horses played a crucial role in shaping the course of human history and the details of this transformative event are still being unraveled.
