Mycorrhizae are vital symbiotic associations between plant roots and fungi, playing a critical role in the health, productivity, and resilience of forest ecosystems. The term "mycorrhiza" means "fungus-root," describing the connection where fungal hyphae colonize plant roots. In exchange for carbohydrates, the fungi enhance the plant's access to nutrients and water, particularly in nutrient-poor environments.

There are two main types: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae, associated with trees like pines, oaks, and beeches, form a sheath around the root tip and extend hyphae into the intercellular spaces of the root cortex, facilitating nutrient and water absorption. Endomycorrhizae penetrate the root cells.

Mycorrhizae significantly enhance nutrient uptake, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen. The hyphal network increases the surface area for absorption, allowing plants to access otherwise unavailable nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi contribute to soil carbon storage by transferring carbon from plants to the soil in the form of fungal biomass and by promoting the formation of stable soil aggregates.
