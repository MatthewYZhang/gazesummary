Cahokia, the largest and most influential urban center of the Mississippian culture, was located in present-day Illinois, near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, flourishing from around 800 to 1400 AD. While its exact origins and ultimate demise are subjects of debate, Cahokia's peak occurred between 1050 and 1200 AD, during which its population swelled to an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people, larger than many contemporary European cities. This rapid growth was fueled by a highly productive agricultural system centered on the cultivation of maize (corn), beans, and squash, supported by fertile floodplain soils.

Cahokia began to decline around 1300 AD due to factors such as environmental degradation, climate change, and social unrest, leading to its abandonment by the 1400s. Despite its decline, Cahokia left a lasting legacy, and today, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, preserving the remnants of this remarkable ancient city and providing insights into the culture of the Mississippian people.
