Fairy circles, peculiar circular patches of bare soil surrounded by a ring of taller grass, dot the arid grasslands of Namibia and Australia, baffling scientists for decades. One early explanation suggests termites create these formations by clearing vegetation and altering soil composition. Studies found termites near some fairy circles, however, the termite hypothesis faces challenges, as not all circles contain termites, and the species vary. The intricate circularity also seems beyond random termite activity. Another theory posits vegetation self-organization, where plants compete for water, with taller grass "stealing" water from the center. Mathematical models support this, though the theory struggles with the regularity of circles across landscapes. Recently, researchers have investigated fungi poisoning the soil. Localized variations in soil composition and nutrient availability have also been suggested as a cause, with compacted soil or variations in minerals creating unsuitable conditions for vegetation. A combination of factors, including termites, vegetation competition, fungal activity, and soil conditions, might create a synergistic effect, reinforcing the circle pattern. Ongoing research highlights the complexity of ecological processes.
