Antibiotics, which were a revolution in medicine, have seen their effectiveness threatened by the rise of antibiotic resistance. This occurs when bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to antibiotics. This development of antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process, with bacteria being subject to natural selection. When exposed to an antibiotic, most bacteria are killed or inhibited. Some, however, possess genetic mutations that confer resistance, allowing them to survive, reproduce, and pass on their resistance genes.

Several factors contribute to this acceleration, with the overuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture being significant contributors. Specifically, the prescribing of antibiotics for viral infections and the premature stopping of antibiotic courses allow resistant bacteria to multiply. The crisis of antibiotic resistance requires a multifaceted approach to mitigate it. This includes reducing unnecessary antibiotic use via education, stricter guidelines, and improved diagnostic testing. Also, improving infection control measures in healthcare settings can significantly prevent the spread of resistant bacteria. Finally, research and development of new antibiotics is essential, requiring international collaboration. The article concludes that the development of antibiotic resistance is a complex problem, but it can be mitigated with the implementation of better strategies.
