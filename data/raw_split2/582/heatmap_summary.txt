Artificial light at night, or light pollution, has become a significant environmental issue impacting wildlife, drastically altering natural light cycles, affecting crucial biological functions and ultimately threatening survival. Nocturnal animals are especially vulnerable, as artificial light disrupts foraging patterns, mating rituals, and migration routes. Sea turtle hatchlings get disoriented and are often drawn inland and away from the ocean. Migratory birds are also disoriented, leading to collisions. Artificial light can suppress melatonin production, leading to health problems like weakened immune systems and impaired reproductive success. Addressing light pollution requires government regulations, technological innovations, and public awareness campaigns to promote responsible lighting practices. Raising awareness is essential for encouraging simple measures like turning off unnecessary lights and advocating for better lighting policies.
