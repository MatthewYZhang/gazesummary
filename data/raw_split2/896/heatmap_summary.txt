The printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century, was a pivotal innovation that revolutionized information dissemination and profoundly influenced social, religious, and political developments. Gutenberg's innovation made book production significantly faster, cheaper, and more accessible, particularly during the Reformation. Prior to this, knowledge was primarily controlled by the Church and aristocracy, with books being rare and expensive. The printing press challenged this monopoly and spread ideas to a wider audience. It transformed the political landscape of Europe, enabling governments to disseminate laws and propaganda, shaping public opinion, mobilizing support, and fostering nationalism. This technology also facilitated new forms of intellectual exchange, stimulating literacy rates, and leading to discoveries and innovations in various fields. The Catholic Church attempted to control the printing press through censorship. One of the most significant consequences was its role in the spread of Protestant ideas during the Reformation, allowing ordinary people to read and interpret scripture. Martin Luther's "Ninety-Five Theses" were quickly printed and disseminated, fueling discontent with the Church and laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation.
