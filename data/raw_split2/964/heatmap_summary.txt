The expansion of international trade has reshaped economies and societies, marking a new phase in human history. Early trade was limited by geographical barriers and rudimentary transportation but exemplified by the Silk Road, connecting East and West while facilitating the exchange of commodities like silk and spices. The Age of Exploration marked a turning point with European powers establishing new trade routes and colonies, leading to the globalization of commerce and resulting in the exchange of goods and the rise of trading companies. The Industrial Revolution propelled global trade further through technological innovations, reducing trade costs. The 20th century saw advancements in trade liberalization, culminating in the establishment of institutions that promoted the reduction of trade barriers. However, global trade poses challenges, including job losses in developed countries and concerns about exploitation of labor. Technological advancements may disrupt global trade patterns, requiring adaptation.
