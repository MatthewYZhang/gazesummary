The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica from approximately 250 to 900 AD, known for its advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and art. The civilization experienced a dramatic decline, which remains a subject of ongoing debate among historians and archaeologists. The reasons for the Maya collapse remain uncertain, several factors are thought to have played a role. During the Classic Period (250-900 AD), the Maya civilization reached its peak with independent city-states. The decline began in the 9th century AD, marked by the abandonment of major city-states, the cessation of monumental construction, and disruption of trade. Environmental degradation, including deforestation, soil erosion, and water management problems, may have led to agricultural failures and food shortages. It is likely that a combination of these factors contributed to the Maya collapse, leading to a gradual decline. Despite the collapse of the Classic Maya civilization, Maya culture did not disappear entirely and continue to persist to this day.
