Atolls and guyots, remnants of ancient volcanic islands, showcase the dynamic nature of the ocean floor. Atolls, often called "coral islands," are ring-shaped coral reefs enclosing a lagoon, formed through volcanic activity and the symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and algae. As a volcanic island subsides, fringing reefs grow upwards, driven by calcium carbonate secreted by coral polyps. Eventually, the island submerges, evolving the reef into a barrier reef, and finally, only the ring-shaped atoll remains.

In contrast, guyots are flat-topped seamounts formed from extinct volcanoes. The difference lies in the timing of subsidence; wave erosion truncates the peak of a volcanic island at sea level, creating a flat surface. Subsequent subsidence results in a guyot, often covered with sediment and past wave action evidence. Their distribution provides insights into plate tectonics and past sea levels, with the depth reflecting sea levels. Atolls' vulnerability and guyots' mineral resources underscore the significance of understanding these formations. Both serve as unique habitats for marine life.
