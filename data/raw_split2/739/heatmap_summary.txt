The Harappan civilization, renowned for its urban planning and trade networks in the Indus Valley from 3300 to 1700 BCE, mysteriously declined. Environmental change is a leading theory, suggesting increased aridity reduced agricultural productivity. Over-reliance on irrigation may have exacerbated the problem by causing soil salinization. Tectonic events are also considered, with the Indus River system being sensitive to such changes. River diversions caused by earthquakes may have impacted the Harappan economy and social structure.

Other theories focus on internal strife and weakening centralized authority due to increased competition for scarce resources. The lack of monumental architecture initially suggested internal social and economic stress as the cause, though recent findings challenge this. Violence and warfare in some Harappan sites suggest a more significant role for conflict in the civilization's demise. The collapse appears to be a gradual process influenced by multiple factors, including environmental degradation, social unrest, and possibly even external pressures. More research, including excavations and climate studies, may reveal the full picture.
