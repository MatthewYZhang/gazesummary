The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a world's largest coral reef system, composed of thousands of individual reefs and islands, stretching for over 2,300 kilometers. It is a biodiversity hotspot and has earned World Heritage status. The GBR is facing unprecedented threats, primarily from climate change and coral bleaching.

Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed by changes in their environment and expel the zooxanthellae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white. While bleached corals are not dead, they are weakened and susceptible to disease and starvation. Climate change is the primary driver of coral bleaching events, with greenhouse gas emissions leading to a rise in ocean temperatures. The GBR has experienced several severe bleaching events in recent years. Other factors that contribute to the degradation of the GBR include land-based pollution.

Efforts to protect the GBR are underway, with the Australian government investing billions of dollars in reef conservation. The long-term survival of the GBR depends on global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Preserving this natural wonder requires collective action and a commitment to a low-carbon future.
