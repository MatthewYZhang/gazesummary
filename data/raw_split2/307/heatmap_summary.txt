Artificial light at night (ALAN) from streetlights, building illumination, and vehicles is a pervasive pollutant with far-reaching consequences for ecosystems, affecting behaviors, community structure, and evolutionary trajectories by disrupting natural light and darkness cycles. The most significant effect of ALAN is the disruption of animal behavior where nocturnal animals like moths, bats, and sea turtles rely on darkness for navigation, foraging, and reproduction, and artificial light can disorient these species, trapping them in illuminated areas or causing them to abandon essential activities. Sea turtle hatchlings instincts to move toward the brightest horizon, typically the ocean, but ALAN can draw them inland leading them to dehydration, predation, and vehicle collisions. Addressing the problem of ALAN requires a multifaceted approach such as reducing emitted light by using shielded fixtures that direct light downward. Also, using light sources with wavelengths that are less disruptive to wildlife, such as amber or red lights, and implementing light curfews or dimming schedules can help reduce the impact of ALAN.
