The region of Mesopotamia, situated in modern-day Iraq and parts of Syria and Turkey, is often referred to as the "Cradle of Civilization," where some of the earliest forms of agriculture emerged, transforming human societies. This development was a gradual process spanning several millennia, driven by environmental factors, technological innovations, and social organization. The earliest forms of agriculture in Mesopotamia date back to around 10,000 BCE. Initially, humans likely harvested wild grains and other edible plants, eventually cultivating them, selecting for desirable traits, and domesticating plants such as wheat, barley, and lentils, providing a reliable food source. Environmental factors like fertile soil deposited by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and the relatively flat terrain played a significant role.  Technological innovations such as the invention of the plow and irrigation systems like canals and levees increased agricultural productivity. The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia was a complex and multifaceted process that transformed human societies and laid the foundation for civilization and it also had significant environmental consequences.
