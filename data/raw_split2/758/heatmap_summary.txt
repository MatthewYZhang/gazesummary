Animal migration, a seasonal movement that has fascinated scientists for centuries, is driven by various mechanisms that remain a complex puzzle. One prominent theory attributes migration to the pursuit of optimal resource availability, as animals seek abundant food, suitable breeding grounds, and favorable climates during specific seasons. For example, birds migrate north in the summer to exploit insects and daylight, and south in the winter to escape harsh weather and dwindling resources. Other factors also contribute to migration patterns, including genetic programming and inherited behavioral patterns, environmental pressures and resource fluctuations, and social learning. Recent research has highlighted the potential role of social learning, where young animals learn migratory routes and strategies from experienced adults. The triggers of migration are often elusive, but they can include changes in day length, temperature fluctuations, and hormonal shifts. However, these remarkable journeys are increasingly threatened by habitat destruction, climate change, and pollution.
