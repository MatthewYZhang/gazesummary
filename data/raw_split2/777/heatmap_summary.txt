The Kingdom of Great Zimbabwe, which flourished between the 11th and 15th centuries CE, stands as a testament to sub-Saharan Africa's developed and sophisticated societies, mastering agriculture, mining, and trade, and leaving behind a legacy that captivates historians and archaeologists. The exact reasons for its decline are still under debate, but factors include environmental degradation and political instability.

The people of Great Zimbabwe were primarily Shona-speaking, with an economy focused on agriculture and cattle herding. The fertile lands allowed for cultivation of sorghum, millet, and other crops. Abundant mineral resources, especially gold, fueled the kingdom's rise, and this gold was traded with merchants from the Swahili coast, connecting Great Zimbabwe to the wider Indian Ocean trade network. Ivory, copper, and other goods were exchanged, bringing wealth to the kingdom.

The kingdom's monumental architecture is a striking feature, constructed entirely of dry-stone masonry. One example is the Great Enclosure. By the 15th century, Great Zimbabwe was largely abandoned, but its legacy lived on in the form of other Shona kingdoms. The city is a UNESCO World Heritage site that attracts visitors who come to marvel at the ruins and learn about its history.
