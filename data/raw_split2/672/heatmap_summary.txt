Urban green spaces, encompassing parks, gardens, squares, and tree-lined streets, have historically served as aesthetic amenities, offering respite from urban density and harshness. Their role has evolved from symbols of privilege to necessities for public health, social equity, and ecological sustainability. Initially, formal gardens and parks were the domain of the elite, such as the royal gardens at Versailles, reflecting a hierarchical social structure. The 19th century saw a shift due to industrialization, where overcrowding and pollution prompted calls for public parks to improve health and well-being. Frederick Law Olmsted championed "breathing spaces" for recreation and connection with nature for all citizens. These parks promoted physical and mental health, while emphasizing social cohesion and civic engagement through public gatherings. Furthermore, the 20th century highlighted the ecological functions of urban green spaces in mitigating urbanization, such as reducing the urban heat island effect. Recent research also supports the multiple benefits of green spaces, which are becoming essential infrastructure for urban health and sustainability.
