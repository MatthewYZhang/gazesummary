Coral reefs, biodiverse ecosystems, face a crisis: coral bleaching, when corals expel symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae due to stressors like temperature, light, or nutrients. These algae provide up to 90% of the coral's energy, and their expulsion causes corals to turn white. Bleached corals weaken, become susceptible to disease and starvation, and may die if stress persists.

Rising ocean temperatures from climate change are the primary cause of coral bleaching, with even small increases triggering widespread events. Other contributors include ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing. Ocean acidification reduces carbonate ions needed for coral skeletons, while pollution harms corals and promotes competing algae growth. Overfishing disrupts the reef's balance by reducing herbivorous fish, enabling algae overgrowth.

The challenges facing coral reefs are significant. Taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect reef ecosystems from pollution and overfishing, and restore damaged reefs, we can help ensure that these vital ecosystems continue to thrive for generations to come.
Understanding the delicate balance of these underwater ecosystems and implementing sustainable practices are crucial steps in preserving these invaluable resources.
