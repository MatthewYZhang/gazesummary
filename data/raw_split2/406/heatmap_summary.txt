Göbekli Tepe, an archaeological site in southeastern Turkey, is reshaping our understanding of the Neolithic Revolution and religious origins. Dating back to 9500 and 8000 B.C.E., it predates pottery, metallurgy, and agriculture, making it the oldest known monumental structure built by humankind. This discovery challenges the assumption that complex religious beliefs and organized labor only arose after the adoption of settled agriculture.

The site, comprising circular enclosures defined by T-shaped limestone pillars, displays intricate carvings of animals, including foxes, snakes, vultures, boars, and gazelles, and abstract human-like figures. Notably, Göbekli Tepe shows no signs of domestic occupation, indicating it was a dedicated ritual center where mobile hunter-gatherers gathered for ceremonies and possibly communal feasts. This suggests that religion may have even fostered agriculture. The site was deliberately buried around 8000 B.C.E. The burial has preserved it for millennia, allowing archaeologists to piece together a new understanding of the Neolithic world.
