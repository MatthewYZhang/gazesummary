Flowering plants utilize varied pollination strategies shaped by evolution for reproduction. When pollinators are abundant, plants invest in showy displays and nectar. In resource-limited environments, plants evolve specialized methods for pollen transfer. Wind pollination (anemophily) is common, especially where air currents are abundant. Wind-pollinated plants produce copious amounts of lightweight pollen and lack nectar or scent production. Animal pollination (zoophily) is a dominant strategy where plants rely on animals to transfer pollen. Plants attract pollinators using bright colors, patterns, and scents, offering nectar as a reward. Insect pollination is diverse; bee-pollinated flowers are often blue or yellow with nectar. Other plants evolved alternative pollination strategies that minimize dependence on external agents. Self-pollination ensures reproduction even without pollinators. Deception is another strategy where plants mimic food sources or mating partners. Coral atolls are ring-shaped coral reefs encircling a lagoon. Their formation involves biological activity and geological processes, including volcanism and sea-level change. Coral larvae colonize the island and grow to form coral reefs. The lagoon within the atoll is often home to a diverse array of marine life. The formation of coral atolls is a slow and gradual process that can take millions of years.
