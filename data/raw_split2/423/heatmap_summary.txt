Monumental architecture arose from the shift to settled communities after the advent of agriculture. Increased food security allowed for larger populations in specific locations, spurring innovation and specialization, which then enabled structures beyond mere shelter, serving symbolic, communal, or political functions. A crucial factor was the accumulation of surplus resources because reliable food production meant not everyone needed to be directly involved in agriculture. This allowed for the development of a skilled workforce that could engage in specialized tasks such as quarrying, construction, and artistic embellishment.

Beyond practical purposes, monumental architecture fulfilled social and ideological needs. Temples and religious structures reinforced shared beliefs, while burial mounds commemorated the deceased. Public buildings facilitated decision-making, and defensive structures protected settlements, demonstrating power. The construction techniques varied depending on available resources, from massive stone blocks to earthworks. Studying monumental architecture provides valuable insights into the social, economic, and political dynamics of past societies, with the size and complexity reflecting technological advancement and the availability of resources.
