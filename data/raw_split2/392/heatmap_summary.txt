The ability to perceive color, a relatively recent development in primate evolution, is the ability to perceive three primary colors: red, green, and blue. Understanding the evolutionary pressures and genetic mechanisms that led to this enhanced color perception is a crucial area of research in primate biology.

The evolution of trichromatic vision is primarily linked to the X chromosome. In dichromatic mammals, there is a single gene on the X chromosome coding for a photopigment sensitive to either short (blue) or long (red/green) wavelengths of light. In contrast, trichromatic primates possess two or more genes on the X chromosome coding for photopigments that are sensitive to different wavelengths in the red-green portion of the spectrum. One prominent hypothesis for the evolution of trichromatic vision in primates centers around foraging efficiency. However, the foraging efficiency hypothesis is not without its challenges. The study of color vision in primates provides a fascinating example of how natural selection can shape sensory systems to enhance survival and reproductive success.
