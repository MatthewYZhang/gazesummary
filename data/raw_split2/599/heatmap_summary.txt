Sleep is a fundamental biological process that is crucial for cognitive functions such as memory consolidation and learning. Sleep is characterized by reduced responsiveness to external stimuli, specific postures, and changes in brain activity, which can be measured by EEG revealing distinct sleep stages, including REM and NREM sleep.

Sleep is not merely inactivity; it actively helps maintain a healthy brain environment by clearing metabolic waste products. Sleep, particularly slow-wave sleep, is essential for transferring memories to long-term storage by reactivating neural activity patterns and strengthening synaptic connections. Also, sleep is important for synaptic plasticity to enhance learning and skill improvement.

Inadequate sleep is associated with cognitive impairments like reduced attention span and decision-making abilities. It also increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's. Improving sleep hygiene, by maintaining a regular sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine, can enhance the quality of sleep. It is generally recommended that adults obtain 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
