Around 1050 A.D., Cahokia, the largest city of the Mississippian culture, emerged near St. Louis, Missouri. It flourished from about 800 to 1400 A.D., transforming from a small settlement into a bustling metropolis within a few generations. Cahokia's success lay in its fertile location and agricultural innovations, particularly the cultivation of maize, beans, and squash, the "three sisters" of Native American agriculture. The surplus allowed for specialization of labor and a complex social hierarchy. The city was dominated by Monks Mound, serving as a ceremonial and political center. Evidence suggests that goods from across North America flowed into the city, including copper from the Great Lakes, shells from the Gulf Coast, and stone from the Rocky Mountains. However, the exact causes of Cahokia's abandonment are debated, with environmental degradation, social unrest, warfare, and climate change proposed as contributing factors. By the 14th century, it had been largely deserted. The city's rise and fall offer valuable insights into the complexities of urban development, resource management, and social dynamics in pre-Columbian societies.
