The Cambrian period, spanning 541 to 485.4 million years ago, marks a pivotal moment witnessing an unprecedented burst of diversification, referred to as the "Cambrian Explosion." The Cambrian explosion brought about a dramatic increase in the diversity and complexity of life, including the evolution of hard body parts. Prior to the Cambrian, life primarily consisted of single-celled organisms and simple multicellular forms. Several factors, like an increase in atmospheric oxygen levels, are believed to have contributed to this extraordinary period of evolutionary innovation. The Cambrian explosion had a profound impact on the course of evolution and laid the foundation for the development of all subsequent life forms. However, many aspects of the Cambrian explosion remain a mystery.
