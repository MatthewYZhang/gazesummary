The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, and stretching for over 2,300 kilometers. It is composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands. The biodiverse marine environment supports a vast array of life and is a critical habitat for many endangered and threatened species. The Great Barrier Reef is home to an astounding diversity of marine life, with over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, 133 varieties of sharks and rays, and six of the world's seven species of sea turtles that inhabit the reef. The intricate structure of the reefs provides shelter and feeding grounds for countless invertebrates. The reef is a critical breeding ground for humpback whales and a feeding ground for dugongs (sea cows). The reef is facing threats from climate change, pollution, and sedimentation. Efforts to protect the reef include reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving water quality. The Great Barrier Reef's protection requires a concerted effort from governments, communities, and individuals.
