Collective memory is the shared pool of knowledge, beliefs, and recollections held by a group, community, or nation, shaping identity and influencing present-day actions. Unlike personal memory, it's actively cultivated through channels like oral traditions, historical narratives, monuments, museums, rituals, and commemorative events. These artifacts and practices serve as anchors, reminding people of their shared history and reinforcing a sense of belonging, creating a cohesive social fabric and fostering solidarity.

However, it is not a neutral reflection of the past but is selective, interpretive, and subject to manipulation by dominant groups who control the narrative. It can also be a powerful force in shaping national identity and can be used to exclude or marginalize certain groups. The digital age presents challenges with the spread of misinformation and the rise of "fake news", highlighting the need for critical thinking and media literacy. Ultimately, collective memory is an evolving process of negotiation and reinterpretation, requiring critical examination to promote a more inclusive understanding of the past.
