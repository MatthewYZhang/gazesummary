Mesopotamia, known as the "cradle of civilization," independently invented agriculture, transforming human society. Its fertile environment was conducive to farming, unlike other regions. A key advantage was the presence of wild emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, barley, and lentils, which grew abundantly and provided seeds for experimentation. The seasonal flooding of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers deposited nutrient-rich silt, creating fertile soils. The climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, further aided agriculture. Despite the successes, the intensive cultivation of land, combined with irrigation, led to soil salinization, reducing fertility. Deforestation, caused by clearing land for agriculture and fuel, also contributed to environmental degradation. Still, the development of agriculture in Mesopotamia represents a pivotal moment in human history, laying the foundation for settled societies, urbanization, and complex civilizations.
