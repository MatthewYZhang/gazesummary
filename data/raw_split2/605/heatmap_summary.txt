Color psychology is a complex field that significantly influences our emotions, behaviors, and physiological responses, impacting our perceptions and preferences in ways we may not realize. The earliest research focused on associations, linking red to excitement, anger, and danger, while blue is associated with calmness and stability, but also sadness. These links have roots in biology, with red signaling danger (like blood) and blue representing the presence of water.

Cultural factors also play a significant role in shaping our color preferences. In Western cultures, white is linked to purity, while in Eastern cultures, it symbolizes mourning.

Color's influence extends beyond emotions and can affect our cognitive abilities, productivity, and even physical health. Green links to nature and relaxation, and blue enhances creative thinking. Businesses and marketers strategically employ color, and fast food restaurants use red and yellow to stimulate appetite. Despite general trends, individual experiences, cultural backgrounds, and moods influence color perception. Ultimately, understanding color allows us to enhance our lives.
