In the evolutionary arms race between plants and insects, each species adapts and evolves in response to the pressures exerted by the other. Plants, unable to flee, have developed a diverse arsenal of defenses to deter herbivorous insects. These defenses are either constitutive, meaning always present, or induced, meaning produced in response to a threat. This complex interplay has shaped the morphology, physiology, and behavior of both plants and insects over millennia.

One conspicuous form of plant defense is the production of secondary metabolites, also known as allelochemicals. These compounds serve a defensive purpose, ranging from simple toxins to complex molecules that disrupt insect physiology. For instance, some plants produce alkaloids, like nicotine in tobacco, which act as neurotoxins.

Dams also exert profound and multifaceted impacts on river ecosystems, often with detrimental consequences for aquatic life and ecological processes. Understanding these impacts is crucial for making informed decisions about dam construction and management. Dams disrupt natural flow patterns, often resulting in reduced peak flows and increased base flows, leading to several ecological consequences.
