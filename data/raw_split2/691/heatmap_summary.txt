Written language, a transformative invention, emerged as a system of symbols representing spoken language. This pivotal development facilitated the preservation and transmission of knowledge across generations and geographical boundaries. While the precise origins of writing are uncertain, evidence indicates independent development in ancient civilizations. The earliest forms appeared in Mesopotamia around 3200 BCE, with the Sumerians developing cuneiform on clay tablets. Simultaneously, ancient Egypt saw the emergence of hieroglyphic writing, using pictorial symbols combining ideograms and phonograms. These systems served administrative and religious purposes.

The Phoenicians developed the first true alphabet of 22 consonants, which proved adaptable and spread. The Greek alphabet further refined this system by adding vowels. The advent of alphabetic writing democratized literacy. The Roman Empire adopted the Greek alphabet, laying the foundation for numerous European languages. The rise of the internet and social media has democratized access to writing. However, this also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation.
