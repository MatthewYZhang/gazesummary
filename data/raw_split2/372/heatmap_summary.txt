The modern media landscape, characterized by the proliferation of digital platforms and online news aggregators, has inadvertently contributed to increased political polarization. A key mechanism driving this trend is the rise of "echo chambers" and "filter bubbles," where individuals selectively consume information confirming their existing beliefs. Social media algorithms often reinforce this behavior by prioritizing aligned content, creating personalized newsfeeds that amplify pre-existing biases. The impact of media on political polarization is evident on social media. These platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for political engagement and mobilization, but also create fertile ground for the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Individuals need to develop critical media literacy skills, enabling them to evaluate the credibility of sources, identify biases, and differentiate between factual reporting and opinion-based commentary. Social media platforms have a responsibility to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech.
