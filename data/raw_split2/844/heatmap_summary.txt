The Hanseatic League, a powerful commercial alliance that emerged in Northern Europe during the late medieval period, significantly impacted trade and politics for centuries. Initially a loose association of German merchants, it evolved into a formidable economic and political entity, dominating trade in the Baltic and North Seas. Its rise was driven by the need for security, the desire to control key trade routes, and skillful political power manipulation.

The League's origins trace back to the mid-12th century when German merchants began forming guilds and associations to protect their interests, ensuring safe passage for goods. Piracy and arbitrary tolls made long-distance trade risky. Towns like Lübeck became centers of merchant activity, with Lübeck becoming a central node for trade to the East in 1161.

The League expanded, establishing Kontore in key cities like Bruges and London (Steelyard), serving as centers for trade, warehousing, and diplomacy. The League secured favorable terms by wielding its economic leverage. Its diverse commercial activities included trading timber, furs, grain, and metals, connecting resource-rich Eastern Europe with manufacturing Western Europe. The League faced challenges from other trading powers and internal divisions, leading to its decline by the mid-17th century, with a few cities maintaining a symbolic association.
