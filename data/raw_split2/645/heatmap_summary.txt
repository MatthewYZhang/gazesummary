Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are among Earth's most diverse and productive ecosystems. These complex communities are built by coral polyps, tiny organisms that secrete calcium carbonate over thousands of years, forming the stony skeletons of the reef. These reefs are ecologically vital, providing habitat and breeding grounds for around 25% of all marine species, despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor. This biodiversity supports complex food webs and significantly contributes to the health of the marine environment.

Beyond their ecological value, coral reefs support local fisheries, generating billions of dollars in revenue through tourism and recreational activities. Moreover, coral reefs are a valuable source of compounds for medicinal research. However, coral reefs face unprecedented threats like climate change. Rising ocean temperatures lead to coral bleaching, where corals expel symbiotic algae and become stressed. Ocean acidification weakens coral skeletons, making them vulnerable. Pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices further degrade the reefs. To ensure long-term survival of coral reefs, efforts should be made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve wastewater treatment, and implement sustainable fishing practices.
