Collective memory, a shared repository of memories, knowledge, and experiences within a group, plays a key role in shaping identity, fostering social cohesion, and transmitting cultural values, and it also an active force that influences present actions and future aspirations. Monuments, as physical embodiments of collective memory, serve as powerful reminders of significant events, individuals, or ideas, shaping public discourse and contributing to shared narratives. Collective memory is constructed through oral traditions, written accounts, rituals, and monuments, which act as tangible anchors for abstract concepts, making history accessible and relatable. They transform the past into a concrete presence, influencing how individuals and communities perceive their relationship to history.

Monuments are powerful tools for shaping collective memory, influencing public discourse, and contributing to the construction of shared narratives. They are not simply static objects, but dynamic entities that evolve in meaning and significance over time. By critically examining the purpose, design, and interpretation of monuments, we can gain a deeper understanding of how collective memory shapes our understanding of the past and influences our present and future.
