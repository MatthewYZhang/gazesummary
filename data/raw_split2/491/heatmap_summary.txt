**The Rise and Fall of the Olmec Civilization**

The Olmec civilization, which emerged around 1500 BCE along the Gulf Coast of Mexico, is regarded as the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica. The Olmecs thrived due to their advanced social structure, art, and technological innovations. As an agricultural society, the Olmec cultivated crops such as maize, beans, squash, and sweet potatoes in the fertile river valleys. They built drainage systems to control flooding and irrigate fields, also boosted agricultural yields but also created habitable land in the swampy environment. One of the most remarkable achievements of the Olmec was their monumental art. The Olmec established urban centers like San Lorenzo, La Venta, and Tres Zapotes, which served as political, religious, and economic hubs. The decline of the Olmec civilization is debated. However, their legacy lived on in the Maya, the Aztec, and other Mesoamerican civilizations.

**The Formation and Evolution of Coral Reefs**

Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems built by coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate. The formation and evolution of coral reefs are influenced by various factors. The primary builders of coral reefs are hermatypic corals, which have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae. These corals expel their zooxanthellae, leading to coral bleaching when water temperatures rise. Coral reefs typically form in warm, shallow waters and require clear, well-oxygenated water. They provide a wide range of ecological and economic benefits. However, these valuable ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats. Coral reefs are increasingly threatened by human activities and environmental changes. Pollution from land-based sources, such as agricultural runoff and sewage, can also harm coral reefs. Protecting and restoring coral reefs requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of their decline.
