Cahokia, a pre-Columbian city that flourished from around 1050 to 1350 CE in the Mississippi River Valley, served as the epicenter of the Mississippian culture. It is known for its monumental earthen mounds that testify to its advanced social organization and cultural achievements. The city's rise was due to agricultural innovation like the adoption of maize agriculture, which allowed for a food surplus, population growth, and centralized leadership. This led to specialized labor and a hierarchical social structure.

The decline of Cahokia started in the 14th century and was due to environmental degradation, social unrest, and climate change, including deforestation and the Little Ice Age. Cahokia was gradually abandoned over decades, with the population dispersing. A combination of environmental, social, and climatic factors is viewed as the key reason for its fall.

The legacy of Cahokia endures through its earthen mounds and provides valuable insights into the complex social and environmental dynamics that shaped the unique pre-Columbian civilization. It serves as a cautionary tale about sustainable resource management and social equity.
