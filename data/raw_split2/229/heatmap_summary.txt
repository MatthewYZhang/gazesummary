The history of life on Earth includes transformative evolutionary events, such as the evolution of flight in birds. Birds are the only living descendants of avian dinosaurs. The transition from terrestrial dinosaur to airborne bird is a complex story informed by fossil evidence, comparative anatomy, and molecular biology. Paleontologists have debated the evolution of flight, which includes the "trees-down" and "ground-up" theories. The trees-down hypothesis proposes flight evolved in arboreal dinosaurs that used proto-wings for gliding, leading to powered flight, and were adapted to living in trees. The ground-up hypothesis suggests flight evolved from ground-dwelling dinosaurs that used proto-wings for various purposes. Fossils have helped understand avian evolution, with *Archaeopteryx lithographica* as a transitional fossil. Recent discoveries like *Sinosauropteryx* and *Caudipteryx* showcase feathers in non-avian dinosaurs. Feathers likely served purposes other than flight initially, and natural selection favored feathers for lift and control. Molecular studies indicate birds are related to crocodiles and alligators. Glaciers create distinctive suites of landforms. Cirques are bowl-shaped depressions carved by glaciers, forming at the head of a valley and containing a tarn. Studying glacial landforms provides insights into past climate conditions and glacier behavior.
