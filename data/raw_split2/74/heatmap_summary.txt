Çatalhöyük, a Neolithic settlement in modern-day Turkey that flourished between 7500 and 5700 BCE, provides insights into early human social organization. Accumulating evidence suggests a gradual development of social differentiation within the Çatalhöyük community, challenging its description as an egalitarian society. Initially, the homogenous architectural structure and uniformity in house size and layout suggested even resource and status distribution.

The presence of differential access to meat resources also indicates emerging social stratification. Unequal meat distribution suggests that certain individuals or groups within Çatalhöyük held higher social status and commanded a greater share of resources. Subtle differences in burial treatment and the presence of symbolic artifacts also suggest variations in social status.

It is crucial to note that social differentiation at Çatalhöyük was likely less rigid and hierarchical than in later societies, and the evidence suggests a gradual process of emerging inequality. In conclusion, while Çatalhöyük initially presents the image of an egalitarian society, the accumulating evidence reveals a more complex picture.
