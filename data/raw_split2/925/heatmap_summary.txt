The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a large coral reef system and a diverse ecosystem. However, it faces unprecedented challenges primarily due to human activities. Coral bleaching is a major threat, occurring when corals expel symbiotic algae due to environmental changes like increased water temperatures. This bleaching weakens corals and can lead to death, reducing biodiversity. The primary driver of coral bleaching is climate change, which increases the frequency and intensity of marine heatwaves.

Pollution is another critical threat, with runoff from agricultural lands contaminating coastal waters. Pollutants can smother corals, reduce water clarity, and promote harmful algae blooms. Additionally, industrial discharge and sewage runoff introduce toxic chemicals. Physical damage from destructive fishing practices and coastal development also poses a threat, along with outbreaks of Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), which decimate coral. Addressing these threats requires a multifaceted approach, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving land management practices, and sustainable fishing practices. Active reef restoration strategies are also being explored. The future of the GBR depends on decisive action to mitigate these impacts.
