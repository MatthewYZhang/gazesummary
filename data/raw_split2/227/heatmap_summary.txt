The proliferation of plastic materials has led to a significant environmental problem, particularly in marine environments. A growing concern centers around microplastics, tiny plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in diameter, and their impact on the health and stability of marine ecosystems.

Microplastics originate from various sources. Primary microplastics are intentionally manufactured, often used in cosmetics, cleaning products, and industrial processes. Secondary microplastics result from the fragmentation of larger plastic debris through weathering, wave action, and photodegradation.

The ecological risks posed by microplastics are multifaceted. One primary concern is their ingestion by marine organisms across various trophic levels. These plastics can accumulate in their digestive tracts, potentially blocking nutrient absorption, reducing energy reserves, and causing physical harm. Beyond the physical effects of ingestion, microplastics can also act as vectors for harmful chemicals, increasing their concentration and bioavailability to marine life. Addressing this global environmental challenge requires a multi-faceted approach, including reducing plastic production and improving waste management practices.
