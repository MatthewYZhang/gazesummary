The Maya civilization, renowned for its writing system, mathematics, and architecture, flourished in Mesoamerica. Its story involves innovation, social organization, and decline. The Maya origins trace back to the Preclassic period where they developed agriculture, pottery, and village life. The Classic period saw city-states like Tikal, Palenque, and Cop√°n rise, ruled by divine kings overseeing religious and political affairs. These city-states were engaged in complex trade networks, fostering growth and exchange. The Maya civilization experienced a decline during the Terminal Classic period where many city-states were abandoned. The causes of the collapse are complex, including environmental degradation like deforestation. Climate change played a role in the Maya collapse. Some studies suggest that a series of prolonged droughts occurred during this time, which could have severely impacted agricultural production and contributed to social unrest. Despite challenges, Maya people persevered and their traditions continue today.
