Coral reefs, often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," are diverse and productive ecosystems built by tiny coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate skeletons. These skeletons form complex structures over centuries. Reefs host approximately 25% of all marine life. The formation of a coral reef depends on specific conditions. Corals thrive in warm, clear, shallow waters with ample sunlight because they have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae provide nutrients through photosynthesis, while the coral provides protection and sunlight. Fringing reefs grow from the shoreline, barrier reefs are separated by a lagoon, and atolls encircle a lagoon. However, reefs face threats primarily from human activities, including climate change. Ocean warming causes coral bleaching, where corals expel zooxanthellae, and ocean acidification reduces carbonate ions, hindering growth. Pollution and destructive fishing also harm coral reefs. Conservation strategies include reducing emissions, improving wastewater treatment, establishing marine protected areas, and promoting sustainable fishing. Coral restoration can help rehabilitate damaged reefs and understanding the impact of human activities will allow the complex processes that govern reef formation.
