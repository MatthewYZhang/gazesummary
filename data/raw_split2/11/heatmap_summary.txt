The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica, distinguished by its hieroglyphic writing, mathematics, and architecture. Organized as independent city-states like Tikal and Palenque, these engaged in trade and warfare, especially during the Classic Period. The Maya faced environmental challenges, including dense rainforest, seasonal flooding, and rainfall, leading to the development of agricultural techniques like terracing. They developed a complex writing system composed of phonetic symbols and logograms to record historical events, dynastic successions, astronomical observations, and religious beliefs. This writing system offers insights into their culture, politics, and worldview. The Maya developed a base-20 number system and the concept of zero, allowing for accurate astronomical observations and complex calendars. Scholars continue to debate the reasons for the collapse of the Maya civilization, including factors like environmental degradation and political instability. Despite this collapse, Maya culture continued through later societies, with millions of Maya people still living in Mesoamerica, preserving their heritage.
