Island ecosystems are highly susceptible to the introduction of non-native species due to their isolation, which has historically limited species dispersal and resulted in specialized ecological niches. With increased global trade, the rate of species introductions has accelerated, often with devastating consequences. "Ecological release" helps explain the impact of introduced species, where organisms, free from natural constraints like predators and competitors, can expand rapidly into unoccupied niches. This can disrupt food webs, outcompete native species, and lead to extinctions. Introduced species also cause significant habitat alteration, with invasive plants displacing native vegetation. Controlling introduced species on islands is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Successful management examples, like feral goat eradication in the Galapagos, show the potential for restoring island ecosystems. Ultimately, long-term sustainability relies on effective strategies and further research to protect these ecosystems. Invasive species are estimated to cost Americans more than $120 billion in damages each year.
