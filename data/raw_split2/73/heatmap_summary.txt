Artificial light at night is a ubiquitous feature of the modern world, impacting wildlife behavior, physiology, and ecological interactions. It disrupts natural light cycles, affecting nocturnal and crepuscular species by disorienting them and altering their movement patterns, leading to increased predation risk and reduced foraging success. Sea turtle hatchlings are often drawn inland by artificial lights, causing dehydration and exhaustion, while migratory birds become disoriented by city lights, resulting in collisions with buildings.

ALAN also affects hormone production, sleep-wake cycles, and seasonal reproductive timing. It can suppress melatonin production, leading to sleep disturbances and weakened immune systems. In birds, it disrupts migratory timing, leading to mismatches between breeding season and food availability. The ecological consequences of ALAN extend to community-level interactions, such as altered foraging behaviors and predator-prey relationships, which can disrupt food webs and ecosystem stability.

Addressing the problem requires a multi-faceted approach including shielded light fixtures, dimming lights during non-peak hours, and using narrow-spectrum light sources. Raising public awareness and implementing light pollution regulations are also important steps.
