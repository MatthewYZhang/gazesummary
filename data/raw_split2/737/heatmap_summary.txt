Atolls, iconic rings of coral islands, are fascinating geological formations. Their existence involves biological processes, volcanic activity, and sea-level changes, forming through a lengthy process over millions of years. The process begins with a volcanic island rising from the ocean floor, built by active volcanoes fueled by magma plumes. However, volcanic activity subsides, and erosion wears down the rock. As the island subsides, coral polyps colonize the shallow waters and thrive in warm, clear, nutrient-poor waters. Corals require sunlight for photosynthesis from symbiotic algae. They grow upwards and outwards, forming a fringing reef around the island. Eventually, the volcanic island may completely disappear, leaving a ring-shaped coral reef or atoll surrounding a lagoon. The reef grows upwards, and wind and waves deposit sand and coral rubble, creating cayes or motus that are vegetated and support various life forms. The lagoon itself can vary in depth and clarity.
