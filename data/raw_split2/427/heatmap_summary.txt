Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is deeply rooted in Indigenous and local communities, passed down orally through stories, songs, and practical skills. TEK offers unique insights into ecological processes, sustainable resource management, and biodiversity conservation, though it is often overlooked in mainstream scientific conservation efforts. TEK encompasses knowledge, practices, and beliefs concerning the relationship of living beings with their environment.

Integrating TEK into conservation initiatives faces challenges due to the difficulty in bridging traditional knowledge systems and Western scientific frameworks. However, successful examples like those in the Amazon rainforest and the Arctic highlight TEK's potential to complement scientific research and inform conservation policies. TEK is not a substitute for scientific research but a complement that can enhance our understanding of complex ecological systems. Recognizing the value of TEK can promote more effective approaches to protecting biodiversity and managing natural resources.
