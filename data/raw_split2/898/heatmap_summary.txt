Sleep is an essential physiological state that has been recognized for its restorative properties. Memory consolidation, the process by which unstable, newly formed memories are transformed into more durable, long-term representations, is significantly enhanced during sleep. This enhancement occurs through complex neural processes, including the reactivation of neural patterns associated with experiences and the transfer of information from the hippocampus to the neocortex.

Different stages of sleep play distinct roles in memory consolidation, with slow-wave sleep consolidating declarative memories, those that involve facts and events. The hippocampus replays neural patterns associated with recently learned information, strengthening the connections between neurons involved in representing that information. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is important for consolidating procedural memories, involving skills and habits. Brain activity patterns resemble those observed during waking performance of the learned skill, suggesting that the brain is actively practicing and refining the neural circuits involved.
