The Cambrian explosion marks a dramatic increase in the diversity of life forms around 541 million years ago. Before this time, life consisted mainly of simple, soft-bodied organisms. Suddenly, a wide variety of complex, multi-cellular creatures emerged, including the ancestors of many modern animal phyla. This rapid diversification is a significant puzzle in evolutionary biology.

Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon, including rising oxygen levels in the oceans, the development of Hox genes, and skeletalization. Increasing oxygen may have allowed larger and more active organisms to thrive, leading to an evolutionary arms race and the development of adaptations like shells and specialized sensory organs. The development of Hox genes facilitated the evolution of complex body plans. The appearance of mineralized skeletons also contributed to the biological revolution.

Changes in ocean chemistry, particularly calcium levels, could have aided the evolution of skeletons and shells, providing structural support. The Burgess Shale in British Columbia is an important fossil site preserving soft-bodied organisms and unique creatures like *Anomalocaris* and *Opabinia*. However, the exact triggers for the Cambrian explosion are still debated.
