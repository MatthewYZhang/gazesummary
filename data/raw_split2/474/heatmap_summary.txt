Paleoclimatology is an interdisciplinary science that reconstructs Earth's past climates, deciphering the connections between geological, biological, and chemical evidence to understand how climate has changed and inform our understanding of current and future climate trends. Paleoclimatologists study various climate proxies, or natural archives, including ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, ocean sediments, and cave formations. By analyzing these archives, they infer past temperatures, precipitation patterns, and atmospheric composition. Ice core analysis, involving deep ice cores drilled in Greenland and Antarctica, provides insights into the ancient atmosphere, including greenhouse gas levels and isotopic ratios for temperature estimation. Tree rings, with widths varying based on environmental conditions, also offer annual resolution climate records. Paleoclimatologists study lake and ocean sediments, analyzing organisms and chemical composition to reconstruct past water conditions, atmospheric dust, and volcanic activity. A paleoclimatologist Milutin Milankovitch developed a theory to explain the long-term cycles of ice ages based on variations in Earth's orbit and tilt. Paleoclimatology plays an increasingly important role in understanding climate change, identifying human-caused changes, testing climate models, and informing climate policy.
