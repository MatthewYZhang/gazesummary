Coral reefs, vibrant ecosystems teeming with life and built by tiny colonial animals called coral polyps, support an estimated 25% of all marine life despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor. Coral reefs provide shelter, breeding grounds, and feeding areas for a vast array of organisms. Rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae. Ocean acidification further threatens coral reefs. As the ocean absorbs CO2, its pH level decreases, making it more acidic, which makes it harder for corals to build and maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons. Runoff from land-based sources, including agricultural fertilizers and sewage, introduces excess nutrients into the water. Overfishing can disrupt the delicate balance of the reef ecosystem. Efforts must be made to reduce local stressors on coral reefs by implementing stricter regulations on pollution and establishing marine protected areas.
