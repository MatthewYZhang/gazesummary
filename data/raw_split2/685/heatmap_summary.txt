Collective memory, a shared pool of knowledge and recollections, plays a key role in shaping identity and directing actions. It emerges through a dynamic process of interaction within a community, providing a framework for interpreting the present and envisioning the future. A primary function is fostering belonging and shared identity, reinforced through rituals and practices that celebrate the past.

Collective memory is not static but evolves, shaped by present-day concerns. Dominant narratives can become the "official" version, but marginalized groups can challenge them. These narratives, often presented through history textbooks and museums, are often selective and contested, as seen in debates over Confederate monuments.

Collective memory also shapes attitudes, influencing norms, ideologies, and decisions. Manipulated for political purposes, it can cause divisions. Understanding its dynamics is essential for building a just future by examining narratives and engaging in dialogue. Ultimately, collective memory should serve as a tool for understanding, reconciliation, and progress.
