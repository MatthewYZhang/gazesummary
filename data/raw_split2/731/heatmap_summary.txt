The honeybee colony, comprised of tens of thousands of individuals, functions as an integrated unit, a superorganism that can be understood by examining its structure, communication, and self-regulating behaviors. The colony is organized around a strict division of labor, with the queen laying eggs, worker bees performing various tasks from nursing larvae to foraging, and drones mating with the queen. The colony's efficient operation is ensured by this division of labor.

Honeybees communicate through a range of signals, including pheromones and dances, to share information about food sources, threats, and colony needs. The queen releases pheromones to maintain worker sterility and colony cohesion. Alarm pheromones alert other bees to danger, prompting defensive responses. They meticulously store honey and pollen in wax comb. Threats to colony health include habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and disease, including Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Understanding the complex interactions is essential for developing strategies to protect these pollinators.
