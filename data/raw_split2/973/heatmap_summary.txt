The Cambrian Explosion, marked by an unprecedented surge in the diversity of life approximately 541 to 485.4 million years ago, is a pivotal event in Earth's history, leading to the rapid appearance of most major animal phyla. Before this period, life consisted mainly of simple, single-celled organisms. However, the fossil record shows an explosion of complex, multi-cellular life forms with hard skeletons and specialized organs in the Cambrian period. This posed a significant challenge to evolutionary biologists, sparking numerous hypotheses.

Increased oxygen levels are considered a prominent theory, providing the energy needed for larger, complex organisms and aiding in the synthesis of collagen for skeletal structures. Another contributing factor is the evolution of vision, which spurred an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey, resulting in the diversification of body plans. The opening up of new ecological niches also played a role, creating opportunities for animals to specialize and adapt. Despite various contributing factors, the precise causes of the Cambrian Explosion remain elusive and further research is required. This event had a profound impact on Earth's history, establishing the basic body plans and laying the foundation for complex ecosystems.
