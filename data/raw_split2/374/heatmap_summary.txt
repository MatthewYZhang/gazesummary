Coffee culture's rise is a story of shifting social habits and global expansion. Originating in Ethiopia and spreading to the Arabian Peninsula, coffee houses became hubs of intellectual and social life, spaces for debate and idea exchange. This popularity continued as coffee spread to Europe, initially facing suspicion before gaining acceptance and serving a role similar to its function in the Middle East by becoming hubs of intellectual discourse. The Industrial Revolution further cemented coffee's role, as workers depended on its stimulating effects, leading to a relationship between coffee, work, and efficiency within the modern economy. More recently, questions have arisen regarding coffee's long-term effects, with health concerns and environmental impacts becoming a point of discussion alongside the importance of responsible, sustainable practices.
