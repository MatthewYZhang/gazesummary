Cahokia, the largest urban center of the Mississippian culture, flourished in the Mississippi River Valley due to its fertile floodplains, which provided the necessary agricultural base. The Mississippian people were skilled farmers, cultivating maize, beans, and squash using efficient agricultural techniques. This surplus of food allowed for a larger population and the development of specialized labor. This surplus fueled the construction of monumental earthworks, including over 120 mounds.

The rise and fall of Cahokia serves as a reminder of the complex and often unpredictable nature of societal development, highlighting the importance of environmental sustainability, social equity, and adaptive resilience in the face of change. By the 15th century, Cahokia had been largely abandoned, with its descendants dispersing throughout the region. The decline of Cahokia, beginning around 1300 CE, involved a decrease in population and a cessation of mound construction. Several theories suggest the decline, including environmental degradation, climate change, resource depletion and social unrest.
