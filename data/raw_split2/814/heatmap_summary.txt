Microplastics, plastic particles under 5 millimeters, pose a substantial threat to marine ecosystems due to their widespread distribution and persistence. Concerns are rising about their ecological impact, particularly regarding their ingestion by various marine organisms, from zooplankton to marine mammals.

Ingestion of microplastics can lead to physical harm, such as digestive system blockages, and reduce feeding efficiency. Microplastics also act as vectors for transporting harmful chemicals, absorbing pollutants like POPs and heavy metals, which transfer to organisms that ingest them, leading to bioaccumulation and biomagnification.

To tackle the issue, a multi-faceted approach is needed that includes reducing plastic waste, improving waste management, and developing technologies for removing microplastics, with bioremediation being a promising approach. The challenge of microplastic pollution is a global problem that requires international cooperation and coordinated action. By working together to reduce plastic waste, improve waste management practices, and develop innovative solutions, we can protect marine and freshwater ecosystems from the harmful effects of microplastics and ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our planet.
