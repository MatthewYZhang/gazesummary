Mycorrhizae, which are associations between plant roots and fungi, are critical for forest ecosystems, influencing nutrient cycling, water uptake, and disease resistance. These relationships, formed by terrestrial plants, affect forest health and productivity. Two main types exist: ectomycorrhizae (ECM), found in temperate and boreal forests, create a sheath around the root tip, extending hyphae into the root cortex, while arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), common in grasslands, allow fungal hyphae to penetrate root cells, forming arbuscules.

Mycorrhizae improve plant nutrient acquisition, especially for phosphorus and nitrogen, often limiting factors in forest soils. Fungi, with their hyphal networks, have a greater surface area than roots, accessing nutrients unavailable to plants, like complex organic compounds. In return for these nutrients, plants provide fungi with carbohydrates produced during photosynthesis.

These fungi can also increase plant drought tolerance and protect plants against soilborne pathogens. Ongoing research aims to identify specific fungal species that enhance drought tolerance or disease resistance. Inoculating seedlings with these fungi in nurseries can improve their survival and growth, aiding forest restoration.
