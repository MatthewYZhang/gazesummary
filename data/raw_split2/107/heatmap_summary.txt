The article begins by addressing the mystery of the Anasazi's decline, a topic debated among archaeologists for decades. The Anasazi, known for their advanced agriculture and architecture, disappeared from the Chaco Canyon around the 12th and 13th centuries. Proposed theories for their disappearance ranged from resource depletion to internal conflict. A prominent theory focused on environmental factors, especially drought, supported by tree-ring data demonstrating prolonged aridity during the Anasazi decline. The droughts significantly affected their ability to grow crops such as corn, beans, and squash, causing famine, social unrest, and eventually, forcing their relocation. Some argue that the Anasazi were simply unable to adapt to these harsh changes.

However, the drought theory faces criticism, as archaeological evidence shows sophisticated water management systems developed by the Anasazi, and some communities persisted in the region after the supposed decline. Other possibilities include resource depletion because the overuse of forests and agricultural land caused soil erosion.

The text then pivots to a discussion of the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid animal diversification. Several explanations have been proposed, including increasing oxygen levels in the oceans, and the evolution of new developmental genes, specifically Hox genes. The theory proposes that Hox genes control animal body plans and that changes in these genes led to rapid animal diversification in the Cambrian. A competing theory focuses on the evolution of predation. The emergence of predators drove the evolution of hard skeletons and other defenses in prey organisms. 

Finally, the article touches on the formation of atolls, those ring-shaped coral islands, starting with Darwin's subsidence theory. This theory posits that atolls begin as fringing reefs around volcanic islands. As the volcano subsides, the coral reef grows upwards, eventually leaving a lagoon surrounded by a ring of coral. Although Darwin's theory is widely accepted, it is not the sole determinant of atoll formation. The rate of sea-level rise and fall, the availability of sediment, and the species of coral present can all influence the morphology of atolls.
