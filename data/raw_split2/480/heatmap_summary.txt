Around 1,000 years ago, a complex society flourished in the fertile floodplains of southwestern Illinois, near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. This pre-Columbian urban center, known as Cahokia, was the largest and most influential Mississippian culture settlement, exceeding in size many contemporary European cities. Cahokia's rise represents a significant example of cultural and societal development in North America, though its eventual decline remains a topic of ongoing research and debate. Cahokia's influence on other Mississippian cultures remained, and its legacy continues to fascinate archaeologists and historians today. The legacy of Cahokia persists through the archaeological remains that continue to provide insights into the lives, beliefs, and achievements of this remarkable society. The reasons for Cahokiaâ€™s decline are not fully understood, and several theories have been proposed. One intriguing feature of Cahokia is the Woodhenge, a series of circular post arrangements that appear to have been used for astronomical observations. Like the Anasazi's solar observatory, the Woodhenge likely served as a calendar, allowing Cahokia's inhabitants to track the seasons and schedule agricultural activities.
