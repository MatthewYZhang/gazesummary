Mycorrhizae, symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, are crucial for the health and function of forest ecosystems. The term "mycorrhiza" means "fungus-root," and these relationships are widespread and ecologically important symbioses. Terrestrial plants, including forest trees, form mycorrhizal associations with diverse fungi species. This interaction is generally mutually beneficial, with the plant providing the fungus with carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis and the fungus enhancing the plant's access to water and nutrients from the soil.

Mycorrhizal fungi extend the plant's root system, effectively increasing the surface area available for nutrient and water absorption. Fungal hyphae can penetrate soil pores inaccessible to plant roots, allowing plants to acquire nutrients.

Ectomycorrhizae, common in temperate and boreal forests, are characterized by a fungal sheath and hyphae between root cells, forming associations with fungi such as boletes, truffles, and chanterelles. Endomycorrhizae, known as arbuscular mycorrhizae, are characterized by fungal hyphae that penetrate the cells of the plant root cortex. They are the most common and widespread mycorrhizae. In conclusion, mycorrhizae play a critical role in nutrient cycling, plant growth, and carbon sequestration. Protecting mycorrhizal diversity is crucial for the long-term health and sustainability of forests.
