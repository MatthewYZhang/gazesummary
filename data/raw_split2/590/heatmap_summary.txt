Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, explores enduring emotional bonds, especially between infants and caregivers, profoundly influencing social and emotional development throughout life. Bowlby, drawing on ethology, psychoanalysis, and cognitive science, proposed attachment is an innate behavioral system promoting proximity to caregivers in times of distress for survival.

Bowlby identified secure base behavior, where the caregiver is a source of security for exploration. Separation distress highlights the importance of proximity maintenance, and safe haven behavior involves seeking comfort from the caregiver when threatened. These behaviors, triggered by threats, are crucial for emotional regulation and security.

Ainsworth developed the Strange Situation to assess attachment patterns. Infants were categorized into secure, anxious-avoidant, and anxious-resistant attachment styles. Securely attached infants explore confidently, show moderate distress upon separation, and seek comfort. Anxious-avoidant infants show little distress upon separation and avoid contact, while anxious-resistant infants display heightened distress upon separation and ambivalent behavior. Disorganized attachment involves unpredictable behavior.

Attachment theory has faced criticisms, including questions about the Strange Situation's artificiality and cultural universality. Some argue it overemphasizes early experiences. However, attachment theory remains a cornerstone of developmental psychology, informing parenting interventions, therapeutic approaches, and educational practices to foster secure attachment. Future research will continue to refine understanding of attachment relationships and their impact.
