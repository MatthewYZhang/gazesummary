Cahokia, located near St. Louis, Missouri, was a large pre-Columbian city that flourished from 1050 to 1350 CE. The city's rapid growth coincided with a period of favorable climate and agricultural innovation, specifically the adoption of maize and intensive farming. This led to a population boom, possibly reaching 10,000-20,000 people, larger than some European cities. This surplus food production supported a complex social hierarchy, where elites controlled resources and labor, and enabled the construction of monumental earthworks, including Monks Mound, which solidified their power. However, intensive agricultural practices could have led to environmental degradation, reducing agricultural productivity and making the city vulnerable to climate fluctuations. Moreover, the hierarchical social structure may have led to internal tensions, and evidence suggests that Cahokia faced threats from both internal and external groups. Overpopulation may have also contributed to Cahokia's decline, as the city exceeded the environment's carrying capacity, leading to resource scarcity. Ultimately, environmental degradation, social tensions, and resource scarcity may have contributed to the city's decline.
