The paradox of plastic lies in its indispensable nature and its devastating consequences. In the mid-20th century, plastic's rise was fueled by its low cost, ease of production, and resistance to degradation, leading to widespread adoption across industries. We produce hundreds of millions of tons of plastic annually, a significant portion of which is destined for single-use applications. The problem arises when plastic becomes waste due to its longevity in the environment, which persists for centuries, if not millennia. This longevity, combined with inadequate waste management systems, has led to massive accumulation of plastic pollution in landfills, oceans, and ecosystems worldwide.

Microplastics, tiny plastic particles less than 5 millimeters in size, represent an even more insidious threat, resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items. They are now ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and can be ingested by a wide range of organisms, potentially transferring up the food chain to human consumers. Addressing the plastic pollution crisis requires a multi-pronged approach, calling for collaboration among governments, businesses, and individuals to implement sustainable solutions.
