Fairy circles, unusual formations found in arid landscapes of southern Africa and Australia, are circular patches of barren land surrounded by a ring of denser vegetation, creating a striking pattern. Understanding how these circles form and the processes that maintain them presents a real challenge. One initial theory focused on biological explanations and proposed that termites, specifically harvester termites, are the cause of these circles, where termites' foraging activities and soil alteration create barren patches. It was also hypothesized that these circles arise from plant self-organization, in which competition for water leads to plant death in the circle's center, benefiting the surrounding vegetation. However, both termite activity and plant self-organization theories have limitations. The challenge is further compounded by the variability in characteristics of the circles in different regions. Regardless of the mechanism, fairy circles are a fascinating pattern in nature. Scientists hope to unravel their mystery.
