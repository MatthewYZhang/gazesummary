Jazz music, an American art form, arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries within African American communities in New Orleans. It is rooted in a diverse mix of musical traditions like blues, ragtime, and European brass band music. The interaction of improvisation, syncopation, and rhythmic drive sets jazz apart, shaping 20th-century music. Early jazz, or Dixieland, featured collective improvisation with instruments like the trumpet, clarinet, trombone, banjo, and drums.

As jazz expanded beyond New Orleans, the "swing" era of the 1930s and 40s had big bands led by Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman. The bands had arranged compositions with improvisational solos, creating a danceable sound.

Following World War II, jazz began experimenting with "bebop" that emphasized virtuosic improvisation, complex harmonies, and rapid tempos. This evolved into a shift that transformed jazz into an intellectual art form. Later came "cool jazz" in the 1950s, with Miles Davis' album, "Birth of the Cool," and then "hard bop" which retained the bebop energy but had blues and gospel elements. Modal jazz then explored improvisations over scales or modes and "free jazz" challenged all conventions. Later, contemporary jazz combined traditions, blended with other musical genres, and incorporated world music elements. Jazz remains an evolving reflection of human experience.
