Atolls, captivating coral islands encircling lagoons, are distinctive geological features shaped by volcanic activity, coral growth, and sea-level fluctuations. Charles Darwin's subsidence theory explains that atolls start as fringing reefs around volcanic islands in tropical regions. As the volcanic island subsides due to geological processes, coral grows upwards, forming a barrier reef separated from the island by a lagoon. Over time, the volcanic island disappears, leaving a ring-shaped barrier reef.

Sea-level changes, driven by glacial-interglacial cycles, also influence atoll formation. During glacial periods, lower sea levels expose coral reefs to erosion, forming platforms for future growth. Interglacial periods bring rising sea levels, promoting coral growth on these platforms. The ecological importance of atolls is significant, providing habitats for various marine life and acting as natural breakwaters. However, atolls face threats from climate change, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, pollution, overfishing, and invasive species. Understanding their formation and evolution is crucial for protecting these ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.
