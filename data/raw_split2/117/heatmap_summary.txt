The Cambrian period, spanning roughly 541 to 485.4 million years ago, marks a pivotal point in the history of life on Earth due to the Cambrian explosion, the seemingly abrupt appearance of a diverse array of complex, multicellular organisms in the fossil record. This explosion of life, including representatives of most modern animal phyla, stands in contrast to the relatively simple life that existed in the preceding Precambrian eon, where life consisted primarily of single-celled organisms and relatively simple multicellular forms, with little evidence of the complex body plans that characterize Cambrian animals.

The Cambrian explosion had profound and lasting effects on the evolution of life. The appearance of diverse animal phyla during this period laid the foundation for the modern biosphere. Many of the body plans and ecological interactions that characterize present-day ecosystems can be traced back to the Cambrian explosion. Scientists are still working to unravel the complex interplay of factors that contributed to this remarkable period of evolutionary innovation.
