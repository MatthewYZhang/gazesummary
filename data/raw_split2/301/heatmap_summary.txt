Coral reefs are diverse and productive ecosystems, often termed the "rainforests of the sea." These underwater structures are constructed by coral polyps, which secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton. The accumulation of these skeletons over time forms the complex reef structures.

Coral reefs thrive in warm, shallow, clear, and nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical waters, with an optimal temperature range between 20°C and 30°C. Corals depend on symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae, which live in their tissues and require sunlight for photosynthesis. This process provides corals with energy.

These ecosystems are facing threats from climate change, including ocean acidification and rising sea temperatures. Acidification reduces the availability of carbonate ions needed for skeleton formation. Elevated temperatures cause corals to expel zooxanthellae, leading to coral bleaching. Conservation efforts, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, implementing sustainable fishing practices, reducing pollution, and establishing marine protected areas, are crucial to protect these ecosystems. Coral restoration projects are also in progress globally, involving growing corals in nurseries and transplanting them onto degraded reefs.
