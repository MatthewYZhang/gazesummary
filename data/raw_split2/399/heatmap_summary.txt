Artificial light at night (ALAN) has increased in recent decades, challenging nocturnal wildlife by disrupting their behavior, physiology, and ecological interactions. It can disorient animals, such as sea turtle hatchlings drawn inland by artificial lights and migratory birds disoriented by urban lights. Predation pressure can increase, while prey access to food diminishes in brightly lit areas. Bats, for example, avoid well-lit areas, which causes a decline in insect populations. The use of artificial light can alter species interactions and ecosystem dynamics and can contribute to the decline or extinction of vulnerable species. 

ALAN's physiological effects are concerning because it suppresses melatonin production, leading to health problems. Mitigation strategies include reducing light intensity, using shielded fixtures, and employing less disruptive light sources. Public awareness and education are also crucial for promoting responsible lighting practices.
