The Maya civilization, flourishing from 250 AD to 900 AD in present-day Mexico and Central America, represents a remarkable achievement. They developed a complex society characterized by a sophisticated understanding of astronomy, calendrical systems, and artistic expression. Their advanced mathematics and intricate writing system were central to their culture. The rise of the Maya civilization can be attributed to their mastery of agriculture, where they developed sophisticated techniques like terracing and irrigation. This agricultural abundance fueled population growth and specialization of labor. They also possessed a remarkable understanding of astronomy and mathematics. They developed a calendrical system that tracked the movements of the sun, moon, and planets. This calendar allowed them to predict eclipses, schedule agricultural activities, and conduct religious ceremonies. During the Classic Period, they produced exquisite works of art and developed a hieroglyphic writing system. The Maya civilization experienced a decline during the Terminal Classic Period, which is attributed to environmental degradation, warfare, and social and political instability. Today, the Maya people continue to live in Mexico and Central America, preserving their culture.
