Cahokia, a pre-Columbian city located across the Mississippi River from modern-day St. Louis, flourished between 1050 and 1350 CE and was once the largest urban center north of Mexico. Its rise coincided with the Mississippian culture, characterized by intensive maize agriculture, sophisticated mound building, and hierarchical social structures. Central to Cahokia are its massive earthen mounds, including Monks Mound, which served as platforms for temples, residences, and ceremonies, showcasing the city's organizational capacity. Its fertile location within the Mississippi River floodplain supported intensive maize cultivation and a specialized workforce, making it a hub for trade. While its political structure remains debated, archaeological evidence suggests a hierarchical society ruled by an elite class. However, Cahokia experienced a decline beginning in the 13th century due to environmental, social, and political factors, including environmental degradation and deforestation. Despite its decline, Cahokia's mounds serve as a reminder of its history.
