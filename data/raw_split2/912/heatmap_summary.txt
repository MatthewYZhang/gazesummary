Invasive species, also known as non-native species, are organisms introduced to new environments, often through human activity, causing harm to the environment, economy, or human health. This introduction has become a global problem. These species outcompete native organisms, preying on them, spreading diseases, and altering habitats, leading to ecological and economic damage. The impact of invasive species on ecosystems can be devastating, as native species may lack defenses against new predators or competitors. For example, the brown tree snake decimated native bird populations in Guam, and the zebra mussel spread throughout the Great Lakes, causing economic losses and disrupting food webs. Invasive species often have high reproductive rates, broad diets, and the ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions, allowing them to proliferate unchecked. The management of invasive species requires a coordinated approach. Prevention is often the most effective strategy. Continued research and monitoring are needed to detect new invasive species early.
