Beekeepers worldwide have observed a concerning trend: the sudden disappearance of honeybees, known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). This loss poses a threat to global agriculture because honeybees are essential for pollination. The health of honeybee colonies faces pressure from stressors, including the varroa mite, a parasite that weakens bees and transmits viruses. These mites harm bees by sucking their hemolymph, which leaves the bees vulnerable to secondary infections. The use of pesticides in agriculture, specifically neonicotinoids, impairs bees' navigation, foraging, and immune systems, making them susceptible to diseases. Habitat loss and intensive agriculture diminish floral resources, affecting bee nutrition. A lack of dietary diversity from pollen and nectar can weaken bee immune systems. While the exact cause of CCD remains elusive, scientists have identified factors like varroa mites, pesticides, habitat loss, and poor nutrition that contribute to the health of honeybee colonies. Addressing these factors can help protect honeybees and ensure the continued availability of their vital pollination services for global food security.
