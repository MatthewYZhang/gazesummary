Cooperation, a widespread phenomenon in the natural world, can be explained by kin selection. This concept, formalized by William Hamilton, suggests that altruistic acts are favored if the benefit to the recipient, weighted by relatedness, exceeds the cost to the actor. Individuals are more inclined to help relatives, indirectly promoting the survival of their genes. Examples include sterile worker ants supporting their queen and cooperative breeding in birds.

Reciprocal altruism suggests that cooperation can evolve through the exchange of favors over time, benefiting both individuals involved. Mutualism promotes cooperation, where cooperative acts directly benefit all participants, such as cooperative hunting in lions and cleaner fish removing parasites.

Group selection influences cooperation, positing that cooperative groups may outcompete less cooperative ones, especially in situations enhancing group-level traits. Social environments, including population density and resource availability, can also affect the costs and benefits of cooperation. Cooperation is not always straightforward, and mechanisms like punishment and reputation help maintain stable cooperation by deterring cheating. The evolution of cooperative behavior is a complex process driven by kin selection, reciprocal altruism, mutualism, group selection, and the social environment.
