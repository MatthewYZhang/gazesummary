The bicycle evolved from rudimentary contraptions to the high-performance machines. Early precursors appeared in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The "Celerifere" invented around 1790, was essentially a wooden beam with two wheels, propelled by the rider pushing off the ground with their feet, but lacked steering. Baron Karl von Drais of Germany introduced the "Draisienne" in 1817, which included a rudimentary steering mechanism. In the late 1880s the development of the "safety bicycle," revolutionized cycling with two wheels of equal size, a chain drive, and a more comfortable riding position. Later innovations included pneumatic tires and gears, transforming the bicycle into a practical means of transportation. The bicycle became a symbol of freedom, and cycling clubs proliferated. Modern bicycles incorporate advanced materials and technologies, making them faster and more efficient.
