Jazz, an American art form that emerged in New Orleans from a mixture of blues, ragtime, and European brass band music. This genre is characterized by improvisation, syncopation, and the rhythmic feel of "swing." Early jazz, known as Dixieland or New Orleans jazz, was ensemble-based and featured collective improvisation by small groups of musicians. The Swing Era, the rise of radio and the phonograph popularized the music, and talented musicians like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington became national stars, saw big bands emphasize arranged music while still allowing for individual improvisation. Bebop, pioneered by musicians like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, emphasized intricate harmonies, rapid tempos, and individualized improvisation. Finally, the core principles of jazz–improvisation, syncopation, and a deep connection to the blues tradition–remain central to the music's enduring appeal.
