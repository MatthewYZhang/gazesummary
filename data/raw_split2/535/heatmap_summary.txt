Jazz emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries from the fusion of African and European musical traditions and is rooted in the African American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana. Jazz is widely recognized for its improvisational character, syncopated rhythms, and blues-based harmonies. Early jazz, often called "Dixieland," was characterized by collective improvisation, and multiple instruments simultaneously embellished a melody.

"Swing Era" of the 1930s saw the rise of big bands and brought jazz to a wider audience. There are different styles in the development of Jazz, for instance, Bebop featured rapid tempos, intricate harmonies, and extended improvisations, and "Cool Jazz" emerged as a reaction to the intensity of bebop, prioritized subtlety, restraint, and a more intimate atmosphere. Throughout its history, jazz has been a dynamic and evolving musical form and continues to be a vital and relevant art form.
