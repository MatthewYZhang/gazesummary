The Great Barrier Reef, a vast coral reef system off the coast of Queensland, Australia, is composed of thousands of individual reefs and islands, spanning over 2,300 kilometers. It supports a diverse array of marine life and plays a crucial role in the surrounding ocean.

Coral reefs are constructed by tiny marine animals known as coral polyps. They secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton, which forms the base of the reef. The Great Barrier Reef provides habitat for thousands of species of fish, mollusks, sea turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals. The high level of biodiversity contributes to the reef's resilience. The Great Barrier Reef faces numerous threats, primarily driven by human activities, with climate change causing rising sea temperatures that lead to coral bleaching. Scientists are working to help coral reefs adapt to climate change. Protecting the reef is essential for the health of the ocean and future generations.
