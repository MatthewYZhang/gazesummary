The Cambrian Explosion, a pivotal period from 541 to 485.4 million years ago, saw an unprecedented diversification of multicellular organisms, resulting in the sudden appearance of most major animal phyla in the fossil record. Life prior to the Cambrian was largely dominated by simple, soft-bodied organisms, leaving few fossil traces. Within a short geological timespan, complex body plans emerged, including animals with shells, skeletons, and jointed appendages. This contrasted sharply with the preceding Ediacaran period, characterized by largely immobile organisms, marking a fundamental shift in the organization and complexity of life.

One prominent theory to explain the explosion suggests that changes in Earth's environment created favorable conditions for the evolution of complex life. Rising oxygen levels and increased calcium availability are potential factors. Evolutionary innovations, such as bilateral symmetry, segmentation, and complete digestive tracts, opened up new ecological niches and allowed for greater specialization. The evolution of eyes, especially compound eyes, is considered crucial for improving vision and enabling animals to become more effective predators. The emergence of complex food webs, competition for resources, and burrowing animals also played a significant role, impacting the distribution of nutrients and benthic communities. Some scientists argue that diversification may have been more gradual.

The Cambrian Explosion highlights the interplay between environmental change, evolutionary innovation, and ecological interactions in shaping the diversity of life on Earth, providing insights into the evolution of complex organisms.
