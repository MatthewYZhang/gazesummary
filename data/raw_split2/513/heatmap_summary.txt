The decline of the Maya civilization, a dominant Mesoamerican culture, is an enduring archaeological mystery. The Classic Maya period, from 250 to 900 CE, saw the rise of magnificent cities, hieroglyphic writing, and complex social and political structures. These urban centers were abandoned within a relatively short period, leading to the civilization's decline.

Numerous theories attribute this shift to environmental factors, particularly drought, as the Maya relied on rainfall for agriculture. Prolonged droughts could have led to crop failures, famine, and societal instability, with evidence of severe droughts during the Terminal Classic period found in sediment cores. The Maya also relied heavily on rainfall for agriculture, and prolonged periods of drought could have led to crop failures, famine, and ultimately, societal instability.

Another prominent theory focuses on internal political and social factors. The Maya civilization was characterized by a network of independent city-states, often engaged in warfare and competition, and growing social inequality and the excessive demands of the ruling elite may have contributed to widespread discontent and rebellion.

Ultimately, the decline was likely the result of a complex interplay of environmental, political, social, and possibly biological factors. Warfare, social unrest, and disease could have further weakened the civilization. The Maya collapse serves as a cautionary tale about the fragility of civilizations and the importance of sustainable resource management, social equity, and political stability.
