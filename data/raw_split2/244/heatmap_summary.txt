The universe's mass-energy content is mostly dark matter, which neither emits nor absorbs light, making it invisible to telescopes. Evidence for dark matter comes from galaxy rotation curves. Stars at the outer edges of galaxies orbit at remarkably constant speeds, implying additional unseen mass contributes to the galaxy's gravitational pull. This additional mass, in the form of a dark matter halo, is necessary to keep galaxies from flying apart.

Ocean acidification, caused by excess carbon dioxide absorption, weakens coral skeletons. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel zooxanthellae and turn white. Pollution from land-based sources, like agricultural runoff, can introduce excessive nutrients and harm coral reefs. Overfishing can disrupt the balance of reef ecosystems, and destructive fishing practices can directly damage or destroy coral reefs. Climate change exacerbates all of these threats. Addressing coral reef decline requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water quality, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and protecting coastal habitats.
