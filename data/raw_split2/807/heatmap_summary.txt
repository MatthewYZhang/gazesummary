Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea", are extremely biodiverse ecosystems that are currently facing a crisis due to human activities and climate change. Ocean acidification is one of the main threats, which is caused by the ocean absorbing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide, leading to a decrease in seawater pH. This makes it harder for coral polyps to build and maintain their calcium carbonate skeletons, slowing down coral growth and making reefs more vulnerable to erosion. In addition, rising sea temperatures cause corals to expel their zooxanthellae algae, leading to coral bleaching and making them vulnerable to disease and starvation. Coral reefs also provide habitat, shelter, and food for a vast array of marine species, protect coastlines from erosion and storm surge, and are important for tourism and recreation. Efforts to protect and restore coral reefs are crucial, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential for mitigating ocean acidification and rising sea temperatures. Ultimately, the long-term survival of coral reefs depends on a global commitment to addressing climate change and reducing human impacts on the marine environment.
