The development of agriculture in Mesopotamia, within the Fertile Crescent, marked a transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities. This involved a gradual process of experimentation and adaptation to the region's environment. Plant cultivation began around 10,000 BCE, with early groups harvesting wild grains and selectively breeding for desirable traits like larger grain size. The earliest evidence of plant cultivation in Mesopotamia dates back to the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs. This led to the domestication of plants like emmer wheat and barley. Environmental challenges, such as low rainfall and seasonal flooding, necessitated irrigation, which evolved from simple canals to complex networks requiring cooperative labor. Along with plant domestication, sheep and goats were among the first animals domesticated in Mesopotamia. The integration of animal husbandry and crop cultivation contributed to a more productive and sustainable agricultural system. While agriculture faced challenges like soil salinization and deforestation, it profoundly impacted human history. Agriculture laid the groundwork for development of agriculture in other parts of the world.
