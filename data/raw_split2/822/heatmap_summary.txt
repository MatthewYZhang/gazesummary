The rise of plant-based diets is a notable trend driven by health, environmental, and animal welfare concerns. Plant-based diets encompass a wide range of eating patterns, including veganism, vegetarianism, and flexitarianism. Specific foods included in these diets consist of fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, which are rich in essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. Dietary patterns have evolved dramatically throughout human history, reflecting shifts in agricultural practices, technological advancements, and cultural values. The shift is driven by a complex interplay of factors, including concerns about health, environmental sustainability, and animal welfare. The growing popularity of plant-based diets also faces some common misconceptions. One such concern involves the perception that plant-based diets are inherently deficient in certain nutrients. However, these nutrients can be obtained through fortified foods, supplements, or careful meal planning.
