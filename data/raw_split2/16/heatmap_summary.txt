Cooperative hunting, an uncommon behavior in mammals, involves multiple individuals working together to capture prey and has evolved to overcome challenges in acquiring prey, often driven by ecological pressures. This strategy is essential for targeting large or difficult prey, as seen in African wild dogs hunting ungulates and wolves hunting elk or moose. These animals use tactics like relay chasing, flanking, and ambushing to increase hunting success, and packs exhaust and overcome prey defenses.

Environmental conditions and social structures also play a crucial role in the evolution of cooperative hunting. Complex environments benefit from collective knowledge and sensory abilities, as seen in meerkat societies, while strong social bonds and established hierarchies facilitate coordinated hunting behaviors in species like African wild dogs, wolves, and lions. This leads to increased hunting success and resource availability but also introduces challenges such as competition within the group.

The success of cooperative hunting depends on the coordination and cooperation of all group members, but faces challenges like competition for resources. Despite potential conflicts, cooperative hunting has proven to be a highly successful strategy for many mammalian predators, enabling them to thrive in diverse and challenging environments, leading researchers to delve into understanding the complex interplay of individual behaviors, environmental factors, and social dynamics.
