Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon marked by a temporary inability to move or speak while falling asleep or waking up. This unsettling experience is frequently accompanied by vivid hallucinations and a sense of dread. While traditionally relegated to folklore and supernatural explanations, modern science is exploring its neurological underpinnings. Normal sleep progresses through stages, including REM sleep, where dreaming occurs. During REM sleep, the brain actively inhibits motor neurons, paralyzing the body to prevent acting out dreams. Sleep paralysis happens when the brain awakens, but the REM-related muscle atonia persists, leaving the individual's mind awake in a paralyzed body. Hallucinations during sleep paralysis are categorized into intruder, chest pressure, and vestibular-motor types. Intruder hallucinations involve sensing a menacing presence, chest pressure hallucinations involve feeling suffocated, and vestibular-motor hallucinations involve sensations of floating or out-of-body experiences.
