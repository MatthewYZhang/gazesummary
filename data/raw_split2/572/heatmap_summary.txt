The advent of agriculture, specifically the deliberate cultivation of crops and the domestication of animals, revolutionized human societies. One of the earliest and most influential centers of this agricultural development was the Fertile Crescent, a region encompassing modern-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran.

The Fertile Crescent's development of agriculture was a gradual transition, not a sudden event. Around 12,000 years ago, during the Neolithic period, populations in the Fertile Crescent began to experiment with cultivating wild cereals and learned to select and cultivate the most productive plants, leading to the domestication of wheat and barley. The early agricultural villages of the Fertile Crescent provide valuable insights into the lives of Neolithic farmers.

Agriculture had profound consequences for human societies in the Fertile Crescent, leading to settled villages and specialization of labor.
The techniques of farming that were developed in the Fertile Crescent are still used by farmers around the world.
The Fertile Crescent's agricultural revolution laid the foundation for the rise of civilizations and the development of complex societies.
