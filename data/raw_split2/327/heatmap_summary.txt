Cahokia, located near Collinsville, Illinois, was the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico. Flourishing from roughly 1050 to 1350 CE, it was a sophisticated society that dominated the Mississippi River Valley. The city's decline remains a mystery. A striking feature of Cahokia is its monumental earthworks, including over 120 mounds. The largest, Monks Mound, rises over 100 feet high and covers 14 acres, making it the largest prehistoric earthwork in the Americas. These mounds served as platforms for residences of elites, temples, and burial sites, requiring a massive labor force and a highly organized social structure. The sheer scale suggests a powerful centralized authority. The fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River provided ideal conditions for growing maize, beans, and squash, supporting a large population. Cahokia's artisans produced pottery, tools, and ornaments traded throughout the region. Around 1350 CE, Cahokia experienced a dramatic decline due to environmental factors and social or political instability. Regardless, Cahokia serves as a reminder of the complexity of pre-Columbian societies.
