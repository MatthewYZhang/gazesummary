Collective memory, the shared pool of knowledge, beliefs, and recollections held by a group about their past, profoundly shapes identity, influences behavior, and provides a framework for interpreting the present. It functions as a societal glue, transmitted across generations and constantly reshaped by experiences, which has garnered increasing attention from disciplines such as history, sociology, and psychology. This collective memory is selective, emphasizing narratives that reinforce values and legitimize power structures. Traumatic events, periods of national triumph, and iconic figures often become central, reflecting a negotiation of identity and the need for coherent narratives.

The media also significantly shapes collective memory by presenting specific interpretations of historical events. Collective memory is a dynamic and evolving process, influenced by new generations, new information, and shifting societal values. Historical events can be reinterpreted, challenging established narratives. The study of collective memory is crucial for understanding social conflict, political mobilization, and cultural identity, enabling critical examination of inherited narratives and the promotion of inclusive understanding. Political regimes may attempt to rewrite history, making recognizing this manipulation crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship with collective memories.
