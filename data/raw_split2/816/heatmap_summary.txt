Storytelling is a fundamental aspect of human culture, preserving cultural heritage, transmitting knowledge, and shaping identities. It encodes cultural values, beliefs, and social norms through myths, folktales, and historical narratives, featuring archetypal characters and moral dilemmas. Indigenous cultures rely on storytelling to pass down ancestral knowledge and spiritual beliefs.

Beyond cultural preservation, storytelling transmits knowledge, making complex ideas accessible. In educational settings, stories illustrate scientific principles, historical events, and ethical considerations, engaging students emotionally and cognitively. Case studies in business schools and historical fiction in literature classes enable exploration of complex scenarios and application of knowledge.

Storytelling shapes individual and collective identities, contributing to our sense of self and understanding of the world. Personal narratives allow individuals to make sense of their lives and connect with others, while collective narratives shape a shared sense of identity within a community. Effective narratives rely on compelling characters and engaging plots, tapping into universal emotions. However, storytelling can be manipulated for specific agendas, such as propaganda.
