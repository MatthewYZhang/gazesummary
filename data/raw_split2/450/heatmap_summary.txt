Altruism, defined as behavior that benefits another individual at a cost to oneself, appears paradoxical from an evolutionary perspective, as natural selection favors traits that enhance an individual's reproductive success. Altruism is a widespread phenomenon observed across various species, suggesting underlying evolutionary mechanisms for its maintenance. One prominent explanation is kin selection, where individuals increase inclusive fitness by aiding relatives, propagating their own genes indirectly. This is evident in social insects, such as bees and ants, where sterile workers sacrifice reproductive potential to support the queen.

Another mechanism is reciprocal altruism, where individuals benefit from exchanging altruistic acts with unrelated individuals, rewarding cooperation and punishing defection. Vampire bats share blood meals with roostmates, expecting reciprocal assistance in the future. Group selection posits that groups with more altruistic individuals may outcompete groups with fewer altruists. The evolution of altruism is also influenced by cultural transmission, where cultural norms and values promote cooperation. Moreover, altruistic behaviors may be motivated by underlying self-interests, as costly signaling suggests.
