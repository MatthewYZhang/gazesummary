Jazz, a distinctly American art form, is characterized by improvisation, syncopation, and instrumental interplay, originating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It emerged from a mix of African rhythms, European harmonies, and the blues. New Orleans is widely regarded as the birthplace of jazz. Early jazz, known as "Dixieland," showcased collective improvisation, with instruments simultaneously contributing to melody and rhythm. Trumpet, trombone, clarinet, banjo, and tuba were common instruments. Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton were foundational figures. This music accompanied social events and dances, contributing to Storyville's lively atmosphere. As jazz expanded beyond New Orleans, it transformed, leading to the Swing Era of the 1930s with big bands like Duke Ellington and Count Basie. These ensembles prioritized arrangements and danceability, offering solace during the Depression, but segregation persisted.
