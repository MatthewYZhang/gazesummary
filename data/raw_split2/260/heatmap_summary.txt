Coral reefs, also known as the "rainforests of the sea", are vibrant and diverse ecosystems. These underwater structures are built by tiny animals called coral polyps that secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton.

The formation of a coral reef begins with coral larvae settling on a hard substrate in clear, shallow, and warm waters within the temperature range of 20°C and 30°C. The larvae, called planulae, settle on a suitable surface and transforms into a polyp. This polyp asexually reproduces and creates a colony of genetically identical polyps. Over time, the accumulation of the skeletons forms the structural foundation of the reef.

Coral reefs are increasingly threatened by climate change, pollution, and destructive fishing practices. Rising sea temperatures can cause coral bleaching and ocean acidification reduces the availability of carbonate ions, making it difficult for corals to build their skeletons. The future of coral reefs depends on addressing these threats and implementing effective conservation strategies for maintaining marine biodiversity, safeguarding coastal communities, and ensuring the long-term health of our planet.
