Cahokia, a prominent Mississippian metropolis that flourished from approximately 1050 to 1350 CE, was supported by the fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River, which fostered agricultural innovation in North America. The introduction of a highly productive variety of maize allowed for significant surplus production, supporting a large and increasingly specialized population, as did sophisticated farming techniques and management of local waterways. However, the rise and subsequent decline of Cahokia remain subjects of archaeological investigation. By 1300 CE, Cahokia began a period of decline marked by population decreases, a reduction in the construction of monumental earthworks, and abandonment of areas. One prominent theory suggests environmental degradation. This decline also stemmed from social and political factors, such as increased violence, resource competition, and internal power struggles, which undermined Cahokia's ability to maintain social order.
