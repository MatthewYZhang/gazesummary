Cahokia, situated near Collinsville, Illinois, was the largest pre-Columbian urban center north of Mexico. Flourishing from approximately 1050 to 1350 CE, it signified the pinnacle of Mississippian culture in the Mississippi River Valley. This culture thrived due to advancements in maize agriculture, where more productive maize varieties were developed. This agricultural revolution sustained a rising population and facilitated social stratification, leading to the city becoming a trade and religious hub.

The city was known for its earthen mounds, with over 120 at its peak, with the largest being Monk's Mound, covering 14 acres and rising 100 feet high. Around 1350 CE, Cahokia began to decline, with factors such as deforestation and soil erosion contributing to resource depletion. Other factors such as climate change, including prolonged droughts, could have contributed.

Hadley cells, large-scale convection loops in the tropics, contribute to desert formation. Warm, moist air rises at the equator and releases precipitation, while dry air descends around 30 degrees latitude. Understanding desert formation is crucial for addressing desertification, and sustainable land management practices can aid prevention. Examples of the sharing economy include ride-sharing, home-sharing, and online marketplaces, but faces challenges, including labor practices and regulatory oversight.
