Writing, a system of visual symbols representing language, is a profound invention, marking a shift from oral to literate cultures, enabling the preservation and transmission of knowledge. The exact origin remains complex. Early forms of writing were pictographic, employing drawings to represent objects. The Sumerians developed cuneiform, initially pictographs on clay tablets. These evolved into abstract wedge-shaped symbols, representing objects, syllables, and sounds.

In ancient Egypt, hieroglyphs were elaborate pictorial symbols. Egyptians developed hieratic and demotic scripts, simplified forms used on papyrus. The Phoenicians are credited with creating the first true alphabet around 1050 BCE with 22 consonant symbols. The Greeks added vowels, creating a more complete writing system. The Greek alphabet spread and influenced the Latin alphabet, now widely used.

The invention of the printing press accelerated the spread of literacy. It transformed society and paved the way for the modern information age. Today, writing continues to evolve with new technologies.
