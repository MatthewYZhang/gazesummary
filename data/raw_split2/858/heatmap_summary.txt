Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, stands as a stark symbol of ecological collapse. The conventional explanation suggests that the Rapa Nui people, driven by competition to erect moai, systematically deforested the island. They used trees to transport the moai, build canoes, and for fuel, leading to ecosystem collapse, soil erosion, and societal conflict. However, the story is more complex. Recent research suggests that the Rapa Nui people developed strategies for resource management, such as rock gardens and careful water resource management. The moai themselves may have had a social and spiritual function, reinforcing communal bonds. The decline of palm forests began before the peak of moai construction, and the introduction of the Polynesian rat also played a role by consuming palm seeds. Ultimately, the story of Easter Island is more complex than the conventional narrative, involving environmental degradation, invasive species, European contact, and the adaptability of the Rapa Nui people.
