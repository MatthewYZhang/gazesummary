Bird migration involves navigating vast landscapes and enduring extreme environmental conditions, with mechanisms of orientation remaining a subject of intense inquiry. Birds use a complex suite of navigational tools, including the Earthâ€™s magnetic field, solar and stellar cues, and visual landmarks. The Earth's magnetic field serves as a global positioning system, allowing birds to maintain a general direction. Certain birds possess specialized cells in their eyes, enabling them to perceive the inclination and intensity of magnetic field lines. The initiation of migration is triggered by environmental cues, prompting birds to accumulate fat reserves for their long-distance flights. 

Migrating birds face threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and human-made obstacles. Climate change is altering the timing of seasonal events, disrupting the synchrony between bird migration and food availability. Conserving migratory birds requires international cooperation, and efforts to protect migratory bird habitat and mitigate the effects of climate change are essential.
