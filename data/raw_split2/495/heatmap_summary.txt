Ants, bees, termites, and wasps exhibit a high level of social organization, known as eusociality, characterized by division of labor, cooperative brood care, and overlapping generations. One of the earliest explanations is kin selection and inclusive fitness, particularly in Hymenoptera, where females are more related to their sisters than their offspring due to haplodiploidy. Proposed by W.D. Hamilton, this genetic system leads sisters to share 75% of their genes, while mothers share 50%, potentially motivating the queen's sisters to help her reproduce. Ecological factors and group living can also promote cooperation. The "ecological constraints" hypothesis suggests cooperation arises when environmental conditions make solitary living challenging. "Group selection" models posit that colonies function as individual units of selection, where traits like size and resource acquisition influence the overall success of the colony. The evolution of cooperation in social insects is complex, involving kin selection, ecological constraints, and group selection.
