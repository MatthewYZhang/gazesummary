The disappearance of megafauna, large animals weighing over 45 kilograms, during the late Pleistocene epoch has puzzled scientists. The spread of modern humans roughly between 50,000 and 10,000 years ago, coinciding with the extinction of woolly mammoths, giant ground sloths, and saber-toothed cats, led to two competing hypotheses: climate change and human impact.

The human impact hypothesis, also known as the "overkill" hypothesis, states that the arrival and expansion of modern humans and their sophisticated hunting techniques drove the megafauna to extinction. When humans spread across continents, they encountered previously naive populations of large animals, which they hunted for food, clothing, and other resources. Relatively small groups of human hunters could have decimated megafauna populations due to the slow reproductive rates of these large creatures, making them vulnerable to overexploitation. Archeological evidence of human hunting sites associated with megafauna remains supports this theory. The climate change hypothesis posits that dramatic shifts in temperature and habitat availability during the transition from the last glacial period to the current interglacial period played a crucial role in the megafauna's demise. Recent research suggests climate change and human impact may have interacted synergistically.
