Mycorrhizae, derived from Greek roots meaning "fungus-root," represent a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plant roots and play an indispensable role in the health, resilience, and productivity of forest ecosystems worldwide. The plant provides sugars to the fungus through photosynthesis, and the fungus expands the plant's access to essential nutrients and water from the soil.

Mycorrhizal associations are categorized into ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae, common in temperate and boreal forests, form a sheath around the outside of the root, while endomycorrhizae penetrate the root cells. The fungal sheath increases the surface area for nutrient absorption.

Mycorrhizae enhance seedling survival and establishment, mediate competition between plant species, and create a "common mycorrhizal network" that facilitates communication and cooperation within the forest community. However, mycorrhizal fungi are susceptible to various anthropogenic disturbances, impacting forest productivity and resilience. Recognizing the importance of these symbiotic relationships is critical for sustainable forest management practices. Conservation efforts should aim to protect and promote mycorrhizal diversity and functionality.
