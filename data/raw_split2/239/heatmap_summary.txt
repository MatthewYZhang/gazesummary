The Mycenaean civilization, flourishing in mainland Greece from roughly 1600 to 1100 BCE, represents a pivotal period in Greek prehistory and left behind a complex society characterized by fortified citadels, sophisticated craftsmanship, and a warrior aristocracy. This civilization, named after the prominent city of Mycenae, was highly stratified, with a king or *wanax* at the apex. Palatial centers served as economic and administrative hubs, controlling agricultural production, trade, and craft specialization. Linear B, the syllabic script, provides valuable insights, revealing detailed inventories of goods, livestock, and personnel.

The Mycenaeans' military prowess was evidenced by massive fortifications and bronze weaponry, and they engaged in maritime trade and raiding. Homer's epic poems, such as the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, portrayed them as heroic warriors, including those who besieged Troy. However, the Mycenaean civilization experienced a dramatic decline around 1100 BCE due to environmental changes, internal strife, and external pressures, leading to a loss of literacy and the Greek Dark Ages, although the Mycenaean legacy continued to influence later Greek culture. The study of the Mycenaean civilization provides valuable insights into early state formation, trade and warfare, and the rise and fall of complex civilizations.
