Coral reefs are complex, underwater ecosystems built by tiny animals called coral polyps which secrete calcium carbonate to form protective exoskeletons, constructing the reef's physical structure. These reefs support about 25% of marine life, positioning them as some of Earth's most biodiverse areas. They thrive in clear, shallow, nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical waters, relying on sunlight for zooxanthellae, symbiotic algae that live within coral tissue, that provide the coral with up to 90% of its energy via photosynthesis. In return, corals offer zooxanthellae a protected environment. This symbiotic relationship is crucial.

Conserving coral reefs protects marine health and supports the human communities dependent on them by ensuring food security, tourism, coastline protection, and medicine. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, in which corals expel zooxanthellae, resulting in energy loss. Prolonged bleaching causes coral death. Coral resilience and restoration techniques like coral gardening and assisted evolution, can enhance reef resistance to climate change impacts.
