The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica, consisting of independent city-states that engaged in trade and competition. Their rise was due to environmental adaptation, agricultural innovation, and sophisticated social organization, including techniques like terracing and water management. The agricultural surplus led to specialized labor and the emergence of a complex social hierarchy. Their advanced understanding of astronomy and mathematics enabled them to develop an accurate calendar system and this system was closely connected to their worldview. By the 10th century, the Maya civilization experienced a dramatic decline, resulting in the abandonment of major cities. Environmental degradation, internal conflict, and the limitations of the Maya political system may have contributed to the collapse. The Maya also maintained their cultural identity in the highlands where their descendants still live today. The Maya's story is a reminder of the importance of environmental sustainability, social equity, and effective governance for societal survival.
