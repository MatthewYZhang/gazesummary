Dams have provided benefits such as hydroelectric power and flood control, but they significantly impact river ecosystems by altering habitats, disrupting natural processes, and threatening biodiversity. One major impact is the physical alteration of the river channel. When a dam creates a reservoir, it floods upstream habitats and changes a flowing riverine environment into standing water, eliminating riparian vegetation and altering the riverbed.

Dams also alter flow downstream, reducing peak flows that are essential for maintaining diverse habitats and cueing life-cycle events for aquatic species. This can lead to sediment accumulation and reduced habitat complexity. Additionally, dams affect water temperature by creating reservoirs that stratify into layers of different temperatures. The release of colder water from deeper layers can disrupt thermal regimes and impact aquatic organisms. Dams act as barriers to fish migration, preventing access to spawning grounds and fragmenting river systems. They trap sediment, reducing nutrient supply downstream and causing impacts on the food web and coastal erosion. Reservoirs also promote invasive species that outcompete native species. Although dams provide undeniable benefits, mitigation measures, and responsible management is important, and dam removal is also an increasingly popular option.
