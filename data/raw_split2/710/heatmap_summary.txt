The study of ancient civilizations, such as the captivating story of Teotihuacan, often presents historians and archaeologists with puzzles. Teotihuacan, a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican city located in the Valley of Mexico, flourished between the 1st and 8th centuries CE, becoming a vibrant center of trade, religion, and political power. The absence of written records from the people of Teotihuacan presents a challenge, requiring researchers to rely on monumental architecture and artifacts. The massive Pyramid of the Sun and Pyramid of the Moon dominate the city, which was meticulously planned and organized with a grid-like layout, revealing a sophisticated administration. Despite its apparent stability, Teotihuacan experienced a decline in the 7th and 8th centuries CE, marked by a major fire that destroyed temples. By the 8th century, it was abandoned and never regained its former glory. The reasons for this collapse are unclear, with theories ranging from environmental degradation to social unrest. The city's art, architecture, and religious beliefs influenced Mesoamerican cultures, including the Maya and Aztecs.
