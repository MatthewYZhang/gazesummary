Play is a ubiquitous behavior in animals, particularly mammals and birds, with no immediate function and often exaggerated, repetitive actions. Researchers are interested in play's evolutionary significance and its role in cognitive, social, and physical skill development. Play was once seen as excess energy expenditure or practice for adult life, but this fails to account for injury, predation risk, and energy costs. Recent research emphasizes the adaptive benefits, such as shaping brain development and improving behavioral flexibility.

Play also provides opportunities to develop and refine motor skills through activities like chasing and wrestling. This helps young animals practice movements essential for adult survival and develop adaptability and problem-solving skills in dynamic environments. By engaging in playful interactions, animals learn social cues, interpret signals, and navigate complex social hierarchies. This social play allows them to learn the rules of their social group and develop skills in communication, cooperation, and conflict resolution. Play can enhance cognitive flexibility by encouraging animals to explore new possibilities and experiment with different behaviors.
