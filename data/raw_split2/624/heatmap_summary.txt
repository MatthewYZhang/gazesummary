The introduction of species into ecosystems outside their native range poses growing ecological and economic challenges. Human activities have accelerated this process, leading to the establishment of invasive species that outcompete native species and disrupt ecosystems. Invasive species can be introduced intentionally, for purposes such as agriculture or biological control, and unintentionally, often transported via human activities. The introduction of the cane toad to Australia and the zebra mussel's introduction to the Great Lakes are notable examples. Once introduced, an invasive species' success depends on factors like the lack of predators and competitive advantages. They can outcompete native species for resources and alter habitat structure, increasing fire frequency, or changing nutrient cycles. Ultimately, managing invasive species requires international cooperation, coordinated research, and a commitment to sustainable practices. Understanding the pathways of introduction, the ecological characteristics of invaders, and the vulnerabilities of ecosystems is essential for developing effective prevention and management strategies.
