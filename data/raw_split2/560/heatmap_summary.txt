Jazz harmony evolved dramatically, driven by experimentation and innovation, from its origins in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States as a confluence of African and European musical traditions. Early jazz relied on collective improvisation over simple harmonic structures, leading musicians to expand the harmonic palette of the genre, musicians borrowed techniques, leading jazz musicians to forge a complex harmonic language characterized by extended chords and altered harmonies. This evolution is viewed as a defining characteristic of jazz, influencing musicians worldwide.

Jazz musicians faced the problem of a limited harmonic vocabulary, prompting them to break free and explore new possibilities by using extended chords, altered harmonies, and new chord progressions. Every aspect of jazz composition and improvisation was used to enhance harmonic sophistication, and pianists, guitarists and horn players played a critical role in this. The use of reharmonization involved transforming familiar melodies into complex structures, allowing musicians to honor traditions while pushing boundaries.
