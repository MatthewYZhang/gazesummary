The evolution of written language represents a pivotal advancement in human communication, enabling the preservation of knowledge. The earliest form of writing, dating back to 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia, was pictographic, as exemplified by Sumerian cuneiform. Cuneiform symbols directly represented objects or concepts and served primarily as a mnemonic device for accounting and administrative purposes, with clay tablets used to record goods. To overcome the limitation of the pictographic writing systems, writing systems evolved into logographic and syllabic forms. The most significant breakthrough was the creation of the alphabet, where each symbol represents a single sound, emerged in the ancient Near East, likely among Semitic-speaking peoples. The Phoenician alphabet, which emerged around 1000 BCE, consisted of 22 consonant letters and was adopted and adapted by the Greeks, who added vowels. The Greek alphabet became the basis for the Latin alphabet, which was disseminated by the Romans throughout Europe and beyond. Despite the dominance of alphabetic scripts, logographic and syllabic systems continue to be used in various parts of the world. The advent of digital technologies has introduced new forms of writing.
