Cahokia was a remarkable civilization that flourished in the Mississippi River Valley between 800 and 1400 CE. It emerged as the preeminent urban center of the Mississippian culture, characterized by intensive maize agriculture, elaborate earthen mounds, and sophisticated social organization. Archaeologists piece together its history from physical remains, as Cahokia left no written records. Before Cahokia, the region was populated by agriculturalists and hunter-gatherers. Around 800 CE, a significant social and cultural transformation occurred with the adoption of a more productive maize variety and a sophisticated agricultural system, leading to a food surplus that supported a growing population and specialization of labor.

The defining feature of Cahokia is its network of over 120 earthen mounds, which served as platforms for elite residences, temples, burial sites, and community gathering places. Monks Mound, the largest earthen structure in North America, covers 14 acres and rises over 100 feet. The city's planned urban layout included mounds arranged around plazas and open spaces, with evidence of residential areas, craft workshops, and religious precincts. The city's population reached between 10,000 and 20,000 at its peak.

Despite its achievements, Cahokia declined and was abandoned in the 14th century, possibly due to environmental degradation, social and political instability, and conflict. By the time Europeans arrived, Cahokia was long abandoned.
