Coral reefs are vibrant marine ecosystems that face unprecedented threats such as coral bleaching. Coral bleaching is a stress response exhibited by corals when environmental conditions deviate significantly from their optimal range, primarily due to rising ocean temperatures. Even a small temperature increase can trigger bleaching events, which severely damage or kill coral colonies. Other stressors include ocean acidification and pollution. The consequences of coral bleaching are far-reaching and include coral starvation, death, and reduced structural complexity of the reef, impacting habitats and food sources. This leads to declining fish populations and reduced growth rates for invertebrates. Coral reefs support tourism, recreation, and fisheries and protect coastlines, but their degradation leads to job losses, reduced revenue, and increased coastal damage. Addressing coral bleaching requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water quality, and implementing sustainable fishing practices. Raising awareness about coral reefs and the threats they face is also crucial for fostering stewardship.
