Mesopotamia, located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq, is considered the cradle of civilization. From the fourth millennium BCE, the fertile land saw the rise and fall of powerful city-states and empires. The regionâ€™s early prosperity was due to its agricultural abundance.

The earliest civilization was Sumer, with independent city-states like Uruk, Ur, and Lagash. These city-states developed irrigation systems, advanced writing (cuneiform), and complex social hierarchies, and engaged in frequent warfare. Factors like environmental degradation, constant warfare, internal political instability, and external invasions contributed to the decline of Mesopotamian civilizations.

Their innovations in writing, law, mathematics, astronomy, and irrigation technology laid the groundwork for later civilizations. Despite their decline, the Mesopotamian civilizations left an enduring legacy that continues to shape our understanding of human history and culture.
