Ecotourism, focused on responsible travel to natural areas, has gained traction, emphasizing conservation, education, and community involvement. Awareness of environmental issues like climate change and the interconnectedness of environmental problems has driven individuals to minimize their ecological footprint, making ecotourism an appealing alternative to conventional tourism. This involves minimizing environmental impact, supporting conservation, and promoting environmental education, thus encouraging travelers to appreciate and protect natural resources.

The principles of ecotourism include responsible travel practices, such as reducing waste and conserving energy. Ecotourists are encouraged to engage with local communities, contributing to their well-being through community-based projects and purchasing locally made products. Sustainable development is also linked to ecotourism, with developing countries viewing it as a viable strategy for economic growth that preserves environmental integrity and social equity. Despite challenges, ecotourism holds promise for promoting sustainable development and fostering appreciation for the natural world, contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future.
