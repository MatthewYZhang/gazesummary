The bystander effect, a prominent concept in social psychology, describes the phenomenon where individuals are less likely to help in an emergency when other people are present. The effect centers on the diffusion of responsibility, where each person feels less personally responsible when others are present, leading to collective inaction. Additionally, individuals often look to others to gauge the severity of a situation, and if no one else seems alarmed, they may interpret the event as non-emergency.

Classic experiments by Bibb Latan√© and John Darley found that the more bystanders participants believed to be present, the less likely they were to seek help for the person having a seizure and the longer it took them to do so. Understanding the bystander effect has practical implications for promoting prosocial behavior, encouraging individuals to overcome diffusion of responsibility. Specific instructions on how to seek help can be crucial, for example, directing the request to a specific individual can break the diffusion of responsibility and make it more likely that someone will take action. Awareness of the psychological forces at play in emergency situations can empower individuals to overcome inaction.
