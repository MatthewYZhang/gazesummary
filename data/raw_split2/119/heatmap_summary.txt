**The Rise and Fall of Cahokia: A Mississippian Metropolis**

The Mississippian culture flourished between 800 to 1600 CE, leaving behind a legacy of impressive earthworks. At the heart of this culture lay Cahokia, which reigned as the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico. Cahokia's prominence stemmed from its fertile location in the Mississippi River floodplain, which allowed for intensive maize agriculture and supported a large population. At the apex of this hierarchy stood a ruling elite who likely controlled resources, labor, and religious practices. The most striking feature of Cahokia is its monumental earthworks. These mounds were carefully engineered structures.

The decline of Cahokia remains a subject of debate among archaeologists. Several factors may have contributed to its demise, for example, climate changes. The reasons for its decline can be understood by using different types of data collected from Cahokia to form a strong understanding of its demise.
