The Nazca Lines, geoglyphs etched into the desert plains of southern Peru, have puzzled researchers since their discovery. Rigorous archaeological investigation has painted a nuanced picture of their origins and significance. The systematic study began with Maria Reiche, and advancements in archaeological techniques have expanded our understanding. A key area of research focuses on when the Nazca Lines were created, how they were constructed, and their intended purpose. Radiocarbon dating suggests they were created between 500 BCE and 500 CE, corresponding to the Nazca culture.

The purpose of the Nazca Lines remains a topic of ongoing debate, the prevailing consensus points toward ritual and ceremonial purposes, with figures depicting animals, plants, and mythical creatures. It is believed that the lines were used in processions and ceremonies related to water, fertility, and agricultural cycles, reinforcing social bonds and expressing reverence for the natural world. Understanding the Nazca Lines is an ongoing endeavor, with many questions remaining unanswered. New technologies and interdisciplinary approaches are hoped to shed light on the enigmatic legacy.
