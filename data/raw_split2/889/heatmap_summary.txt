Soil is a complex ecosystem teeming with microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists, and viruses, which are the foundation of soil health. These organisms are essential for sustaining plant life and regulating biogeochemical cycles. The distribution of soil microorganisms is affected by soil type, organic matter content, moisture, temperature and pH. Microorganisms break down complex compounds into simpler substances, releasing nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that plants can absorb. Bacteria and fungi decompose organic matter, while others form symbiotic relationships, increasing nutrient uptake and water absorption by plants. Soil microorganisms are essential for nitrogen fixation, converting nitrogen into ammonia, which plants can use. Human activities and intensive agricultural practices like excessive fertilization and pesticide use disrupt microbial populations, while soil erosion, deforestation and urbanization also negatively affect soil microbial communities. Understanding their function is crucial for promoting sustainable agriculture, environmental conservation, and climate change mitigation.
