Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are facing a crisis known as coral bleaching, which threatens their existence. This phenomenon involves the whitening of corals and endangers the diverse marine life they support. Corals, colonies of tiny animals called polyps, have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, algae residing in coral tissue that provides energy through photosynthesis. The coral, in return, offers the algae shelter and nutrients; this partnership is vital for the reef ecosystem.

Coral bleaching occurs when corals expel zooxanthellae due to environmental stress, primarily rising sea temperatures. This causes the algae to produce toxic compounds, leading the coral to expel them. Bleached corals, while not necessarily dead, weaken, and the corals are more susceptible to disease and starvation. The impact extends beyond the corals themselves; coral reefs provide habitat for many marine species, from fish to sea turtles, and support fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection.

Efforts to protect coral reefs from bleaching are focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving water quality. Selectively breeding corals and transplanting them is one approach. Restoring damaged reefs with fragments grown in nurseries could also help rebuild populations. The future of coral reefs is uncertain, but action is needed to address climate change, reduce pollution, and protect coral reefs.
