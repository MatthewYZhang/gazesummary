Since the 1930s, astrophysicists have been trying to understand why the universe appears to contain much more mass than can be observed, this "missing mass" is now called dark matter. Its existence is inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter and the large-scale structure of the universe.

In 1933, Fritz Zwicky analyzed the Coma Cluster and found that the galaxies were moving faster than expected, and he proposed that there must be a substantial amount of unseen matter providing the extra gravitational pull needed to hold the cluster together. In the 1970s, Vera Rubin and Kent Ford studied the orbital speeds of stars in galaxies and found that the speeds remained constant or even increased with distance from the galactic center. The flat rotation curves suggested that galaxies are embedded in a halo of dark matter extending far beyond the visible stars and gas.

The nature of dark matter remains one of the biggest unsolved problems in physics. Several candidates have been proposed, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, and sterile neutrinos. WIMPs are hypothetical particles that interact with the weak nuclear force but not with the electromagnetic force, making them difficult to detect. Despite numerous experimental efforts, no direct detection of dark matter has been confirmed. The search for dark matter is a major focus of modern astrophysics.
