Music, a universal language, has been an integral part of human culture since prehistoric times. Early humans created music using their bodies through clapping, stomping, and vocalizations. As societies evolved, musical expression expanded. The earliest instruments were simple, often crafted from readily available materials. Percussion instruments, such as rattles and drums, were among the first, used for musical and ritualistic purposes, accompanying dances, ceremonies, and storytelling. Flutes and whistles also emerged early on. The bow and arrow may have inspired the first stringed instruments such as harps, lyres, and zithers developed in ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia and Egypt. Organ building reached new heights during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, with organs becoming a centerpiece of churches. The invention of the electric guitar amplified sound and paved the way for rock and roll. Synthesizers created entirely new sounds and textures, revolutionizing electronic music. The evolution of musical instruments reflects cultural, technological, and social changes throughout history.
