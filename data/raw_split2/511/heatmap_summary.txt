The Mayan civilization, which thrived in Mesoamerica from around 250 AD to 900 AD, is distinguished by its advanced intellectual achievements, especially its writing system. Unlike other systems primarily for administrative or economic reasons, Mayan writing was closely associated with the elite and their religious and dynastic affairs. It is a logosyllabic system that blends logograms, which are symbols representing entire words or concepts, with syllabograms, which are symbols that represent syllables. This enabled the Maya to convey a wide range of information. While initial assumptions limited it to calendrical and astronomical data, it has been found to reveal rich and diverse content. Mayan writing dates back to the Preclassic period, with inscriptions on monuments and pottery that demonstrate the gradual development of the writing system. During the Classic period, the system reached its peak and became more elaborate with books made of bark paper. The decipherment of Mayan writing was a long process that was hampered by assumptions that each glyph represented a word. It was until the mid-20th century that Yuri Knorozov recognized its syllabic nature and that combining the syllables made the texts phonetically readable. Mayan codices, only four of which have survived, contain a wealth of information on Mayan religion. Despite progress, many texts are poorly understood, and various factors make the task of interpreting the texts difficult. The study of the Mayan system continues to evolve.
