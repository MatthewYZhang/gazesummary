The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed the remarkable rise of coffee culture globally, transforming it from a simple morning beverage into a social phenomenon. Prior to this boom, coffee consumption was mostly at home or traditional diners. However, the emergence of specialty coffee shops revolutionized the industry, offering a diverse menu from espressos to lattes and creating a comfortable atmosphere with Wi-Fi, turning coffee consumption into an experience.

Technology played a significant role in this, with efficient espresso machines and online platforms allowing baristas to produce consistent beverages. Globalization also fueled this demand, exposing consumers to specialty coffees from various regions like Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and Sumatran Mandheling, each with distinct flavors. The economic impact has been substantial, creating jobs. Despite challenges like price volatility and sustainability, coffee culture continues to evolve, with innovations like cold brew and oat milk lattes, likely remaining a central element in modern society.
