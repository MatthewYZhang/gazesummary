Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by living organisms. The phenomenon is found throughout the biological world, from fireflies to deep-sea creatures, playing a crucial role in ecological processes. The chemical basis of bioluminescence is a reaction between a luciferin and a luciferase, requiring oxygen and other cofactors. The reaction produces light, whose color and intensity vary based on the molecules and organism. Though the fundamental chemistry is similar, the exact luciferins and luciferases differ, resulting in various bioluminescent displays. Bioluminescence is more prevalent in marine environments, where it aids communication, hunting, predator avoidance, and camouflage. The anglerfish's lure, populated with bioluminescent bacteria, attracts prey. Bioluminescence has also found applications in biotechnology and medicine. Luciferases can be used as reporter genes to track gene expression and protein activity. Bioluminescent imaging enables non-invasive visualization of biological processes. Recent research is focused on understanding the evolutionary origins and diversity of luciferin-luciferase systems.
