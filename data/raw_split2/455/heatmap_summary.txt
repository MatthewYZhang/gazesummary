Jazz, a distinctly American art form, originated in the African American communities of New Orleans at the turn of the 20th century. It emerged from the fusion of blues, ragtime, and European musical traditions, quickly becoming a unique genre known for improvisation, syncopation, and a dynamic rhythmic pulse. Its origins reflect the social and cultural climate of that era.

Early jazz, or "Dixieland" or "New Orleans Jazz," showcased small groups collectively improvising melodies over a steady beat. Key instruments included the trumpet, clarinet, trombone, piano, and drums, with musicians like Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and Sidney Bechet pioneering and shaping jazz's early style.

Jazz continued to transform in the 21st century, with artists incorporating elements of rock, funk, hip-hop, and world music. Jazz has also played a significant role in the struggle for civil rights. The legacy of Jazz is seen in many modern genres, including R&B, Funk and Pop. Without the pioneering works of Jazz musicians many contemporary sounds and rhythms would not be possible.
