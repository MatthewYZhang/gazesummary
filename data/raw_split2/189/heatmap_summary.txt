Cahokia, a significant urban center of the Mississippian culture near present-day Collinsville, Illinois, flourished from 800 to 1400 CE. Its peak population around 1100 CE was estimated between 10,000 and 20,000. The city was characterized by sophisticated agriculture, monumental architecture, and a hierarchical social structure. However, Cahokia was largely abandoned by the 14th century.

The success of Cahokia was linked to its agricultural productivity. The Mississippi River's fertile floodplains provided ideal conditions for maize agriculture. Cahokians developed advanced farming techniques, including intensive cultivation, enabling them to produce significant agricultural surpluses. This supported a non-agricultural population that oversaw the city's construction, religious practices, and political administration.

Recent archaeological evidence suggests that a major flood occurred in the Cahokia region around 1350 CE, which may have contributed to its decline. Environmental degradation, climate change, social unrest, and competition likely contributed to Cahokia's eventual decline, yet the precise causes remain a mystery.
