Bird migration is a regular seasonal movement between breeding and wintering grounds, representing a complex phenomenon. While the pattern is known, how birds manage such incredible journeys, covering thousands of miles, is still being researched. Birds use both internal and external cues for navigation. Internal cues involve the biological clock, or circadian rhythm, which governs aspects like when to sleep, eat, and migrate, with changes in day length triggering migratory behavior. External cues include the Earth's magnetic field, visual landmarks, and star constellations. Birds possess the ability to sense and orient themselves using Earth's magnetic field. These migratory routes and landmarks are learned from parents or experienced individuals. The physiological demands are immense, requiring birds to accumulate large fat reserves. Conservation efforts should focus on protecting migratory birds and habitats by preserving key stopover sites, reducing pollution, and mitigating climate change.
