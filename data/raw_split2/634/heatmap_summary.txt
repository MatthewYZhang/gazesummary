The Maya civilization, known for its advanced mathematics, astronomy, and sophisticated writing system, flourished in Mesoamerica. During the Classic period, the Maya achieved remarkable intellectual feats and developed a hieroglyphic writing system to record their history, mythology, and knowledge. Their significant advances in mathematics included the concept of zero, and they used astronomy to create accurate calendars and predict celestial events. The Maya built impressive cities adorned with towering pyramids, palaces, and sculptures, which served as centers of political, religious, and economic activity.

The civilization experienced a dramatic decline beginning in the 9th century AD. One theory attributes the collapse to ecological factors such as deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution, which may have reduced agricultural productivity and led to famine. Evidence of prolonged droughts during the late Classic period supports this theory.

Another explanation focuses on warfare and political instability, where escalating conflicts disrupted trade networks, destabilized political structures, and resulted in significant loss of life. Environmental stress may have triggered conflicts over resources, which further destabilized the political system and exacerbated environmental problems. Despite the collapse, the Maya people continued to thrive and maintained many of the traditions of their predecessors. The legacy of the Maya civilization continues to inspire and intrigue researchers.
