Dark matter constitutes a significant portion of the universe's mass, approximately 85%, and is inferred by gravitational effects on visible matter. This unseen matter doesn't interact with light, rendering it invisible to telescopes. The concept emerged when Fritz Zwicky observed galaxies moving faster than predicted, suggesting additional gravitational pull. Observations of stars rotating faster at the outer edges of galaxies further supported the existence of a dark matter halo.

The nature of dark matter is still unknown, with leading candidates being weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), which interact through the weak nuclear force and gravity, and axions, extremely light particles interacting weakly with ordinary matter. Other possibilities include sterile neutrinos, primordial black holes, and even modifications to the laws of gravity. The search for dark matter is a key endeavor and its distribution plays a role in forming large-scale structures in the universe, supported by the observed distribution of galaxies matching simulations. Direct detection remains elusive, but indirect methods like searching for annihilation products offer avenues for investigation. Despite the mystery, the undeniable presence of dark matter has profound implications.
