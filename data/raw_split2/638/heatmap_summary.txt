The Cambrian period, which occurred approximately 541 to 485.4 million years ago, marked a significant period in Earth's history known as the Cambrian explosion. It was characterized by an unprecedented diversification of life, with the emergence of most major animal phyla in the fossil record during a relatively short geological period. During the Cambrian period, organisms developed complex body plans, including features such as skeletons, segmented bodies, jointed appendages, and eyes. These creatures are preserved in fossil deposits like the Burgess Shale and the Chengjiang fossil site. Some examples are *Anomalocaris*, a large predatory arthropod, and *Hallucigenia*. Several theories attempt to explain the Cambrian explosion, with one theory focusing on the increase of oxygen levels during the late Precambrian and early Cambrian periods, which may have facilitated more complex metabolisms and protective layers like exoskeletons. Another hypothesis emphasizes the evolutionary arms race between predators and prey, where improved predatory strategies led to the evolution of sophisticated defenses. Finally, some believe the answer is in new genetic mechanisms such as Hox genes. Urban sociology studies urban growth and environmental problems.
