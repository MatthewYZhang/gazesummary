The development of writing in Mesopotamia began around 8000 BCE with tokens representing goods for basic accounting, and the token system evolved into impressed signs on clay tablets by the late fourth millennium BCE. Proto-cuneiform was primarily used for administrative purposes. Over time, pictograms evolved into more stylized symbols, leading to cuneiform and phonograms. Cuneiform allowed scribes to express abstract concepts and grammatical relationships, and the use of cuneiform writing spread throughout the Near East. Cuneiform tablets provide insights into ancient Mesopotamian societies.

Social factors, such as norms, peer pressure, and authority, can influence decision-making. Understanding these psychological factors can help individuals make better decisions and reduce the negative consequences of cognitive biases and emotional influences. Mitigation requires self-awareness, critical thinking, and a willingness to challenge assumptions and beliefs.
