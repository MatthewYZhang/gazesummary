Around 1900, the American chestnut dominated eastern North American forests, comprising up to 25% of some areas, reaching heights of over 100 feet and diameters exceeding 10 feet. Prized for rapid growth and durable wood, chestnuts played a vital role in the ecosystem, providing food and shelter and being economically important. However, the tree's golden age was short-lived due to chestnut blight, introduced from Asia in 1904. The disease rapidly decimated the American chestnut population after a fungal pathogen entered the tree through wounds and girdled the trunk.

Unlike Asian chestnuts, the American chestnut had no natural defenses against the blight. Billions of trees died, transforming forests. By the 1950s, it was functionally extinct. Despite this, the root systems remained alive, prompting efforts to restore the species. Approaches include hybridization with Asian chestnuts, genetic modification, and biological control. One promising approach involves crossing American chestnuts with blight-resistant Asian chestnuts. Scientists are also exploring genetic modification, and biological control to combat the blight. The restoration is a long process, but progress offers hope for the future.
