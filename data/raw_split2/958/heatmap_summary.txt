The Angkor Empire, flourishing in present-day Cambodia from the 9th to 15th centuries, exemplifies human ingenuity. It left a legacy of architectural and artistic achievements, including Angkor Wat. The empire's foundation was laid by Jayavarman II in 802 CE, who declared himself a "universal monarch." Angkor's kings were considered divine figures, underpinning the empire's social and political structure. Rulers prioritized water management, constructing an irrigation system of reservoirs, canals, and moats. This hydraulic network supported agriculture, especially rice cultivation, allowing for a large population and the construction of monumental temples.

The empire reached its height under Suryavarman II (1113-1150 CE), who commissioned Angkor Wat, a symbol of the empire's power. Subsequent rulers expanded Angkor, transforming it into a thriving urban center for trade, religion, and artistic innovation. However, the empire faced challenges, including a shift to Theravada Buddhism, which weakened the authority of rulers. Environmental degradation, external pressures, and the rise of the Ayutthaya kingdom also contributed to Angkor's decline. In 1431, Ayutthayan forces sacked Angkor, leading to the relocation of the court to Phnom Penh.
