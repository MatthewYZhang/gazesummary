Cahokia, located near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, flourished from approximately 1050 to 1350 CE and was the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico. It was a major center of the Mississippian culture, known for its distinctive mound building, sophisticated agriculture, and complex social organization. Cahokia eventually declined, and archaeologists and historians have debated the reasons for its collapse.

Cahokia's defining features were its monumental earthworks, and the city contained over 120 mounds, ranging in size from small platforms to massive structures. Monks Mound is the largest earthen mound in North America. These mounds served various purposes, including residences for elite members of society, platforms for temples and public buildings, and burial sites. The construction of these mounds required enormous amounts of labor and careful planning.

Cahokia’s economy was based on intensive agriculture, primarily the cultivation of maize (corn). The city was a stratified society, with a clear hierarchy of social classes. At the top were the elite, who lived on the large mounds and controlled the city’s political and religious institutions.
