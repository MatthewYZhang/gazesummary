Ball lightning is a rare, unexplained atmospheric phenomenon that has puzzled scientists for centuries, manifesting as luminous, spherical objects that float or drift. It appears during thunderstorms or clear weather, adding to its enigma, and it is difficult to study definitively due to its elusive nature.

Descriptions vary widely, with colors ranging from white and yellow to red, orange, and blue, and brightness from a dim glow to intense light. It often has a distinct odor, and its longevity allows observers to witness its movement and behavior, contrasting with streak lightning.

Numerous theories attempt to explain its formation, but none are universally accepted. One theory suggests ball lightning is formed by soil vaporization from a lightning strike, creating a plasma ball sustained by chemical reactions. Another theory proposes electromagnetic radiation trapped in a spherical cavity. Studying ball lightning raises fundamental questions about the nature of scientific inquiry and understanding of the natural world.
