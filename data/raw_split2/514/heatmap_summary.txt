The enigma of dark matter has intrigued cosmologists and astrophysicists for decades. Dark matter is distinct from ordinary matter because it does not interact with light, making it invisible to telescopes, but its presence can be inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter. Strong evidence suggests dark matter makes up a significant part of the universe's mass-energy density.

Hints of dark matter's existence came from galaxy rotation curves, starting with Fritz Zwicky's observations in the 1930s. He found that galaxies in the Coma Cluster moved faster than expected based on the visible matter, leading him to propose an unseen "dark matter" provided additional gravitational binding to keep the cluster from flying apart. Vera Rubin's measurements in the 1970s revealed that stars at the outer edges of galaxies orbited at constant speeds or even increased with distance, defying Newtonian physics and indicating the presence of dark matter.

Further evidence comes from gravitational lensing, where massive objects warp spacetime, bending light from distant sources. The amount of observed lensing often exceeds the visible matter, suggesting additional mass in the form of dark matter. Observations of the Bullet Cluster, a collision of two galaxy clusters, provide compelling evidence, where the visible matter and dark matter components have been separated.

The precise nature of dark matter remains a mystery, with leading hypotheses suggesting it is composed of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Experiments are underway to detect dark matter particles, and scientists hope to solve the enigma of dark matter, revealing the true composition of the cosmos.
