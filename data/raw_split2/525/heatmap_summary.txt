Coral reefs, known as the "rainforests of the sea," are diverse ecosystems created by colonies of coral polyps. Their formation, composition, and support of life are crucial to their significance, highlighting their threats. Reefs form slowly over millennia as coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate skeletons. These skeletons accumulate, forming massive structures in warm, shallow waters, ideally between 20°C and 30°C at depths under 50 meters to allow photosynthesis. The vibrant colors are attributed to zooxanthellae algae living in coral tissues, providing energy through photosynthesis. This mutualistic relationship is vital, as without zooxanthellae, corals can bleach and die, which is often triggered by rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification. Coral reefs support diverse marine life, serving as shelter and food sources for many species. They also provide important economic resources through tourism and fisheries. Efforts to protect and restore reefs are crucial using marine protected areas, sustainable fishing, and reducing carbon emissions, alongside innovative techniques like coral gardening.
