Cooperative hunting is a strategy employed by social predators like wolves and African wild dogs to capture prey that would be difficult to subdue individually. While cooperation involves sharing the kill, which can be costly, it can also provide access to larger, more nutritious prey that outweigh the cost of sharing. This is evident in wolf packs hunting elk or caribou. This can employ strategies such as flanking maneuvers, relay chases, and ambushes, increasing the probability of capturing prey.

Musical instruments function through the application of physics, with sound production rooted in wave mechanics, resonance, and harmonic relationships. Understanding these principles allows for appreciating the intricate designs and science behind music. String instruments produce sound through vibrating strings, influenced by length, tension, and mass. Wind instruments utilize vibrating air columns within tubes, with the length and shape of the tube determining resonant frequencies. Percussion instruments, such as drums and xylophones, generate sound through striking, shaking, or scraping. Resonance and harmonics also play crucial roles in sound production, influencing timbre and tone quality.
