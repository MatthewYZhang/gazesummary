The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica, renowned for its advancements in mathematics, astronomy, hieroglyphic writing, and art. They built impressive cities and irrigation systems, but experienced a dramatic decline during the Terminal Classic period, leading to the abandonment of urban centers. The collapse is attributed to a confluence of factors, including environmental degradation, internal conflict, and climate change. The Maya civilization was not a unified empire but a collection of independent city-states, relying on agriculture for their economy. Despite their decline, Maya civilization and peoples persisted, and their legacy continues to enrich Mesoamerica. It is important to remember that the Maya civilization did not simply vanish. The Maya experience offers insights into sustainable resource management, peaceful conflict resolution, and adaptation to climate change, serving as a reminder of the vulnerability of civilizations to environmental degradation, social unrest, and natural disasters.
