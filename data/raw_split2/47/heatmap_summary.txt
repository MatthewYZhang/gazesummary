Cahokia was the largest and most influential urban center of the Mississippian culture, located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. Around 1100 CE, at its peak, its population was estimated between 10,000 and 20,000, possibly even exceeding that of London at the time. Several factors are commonly cited to explain Cahokia's emergence as a dominant regional center. A prominent theory emphasizes the role of agricultural innovation and surplus production. The adoption of a new variety of maize (corn) that was more productive and adaptable to the local climate enabled Cahokia's inhabitants to generate significant food surpluses. This surplus, in turn, supported a growing population. Cahokia's impressive monumental architecture suggests a sophisticated level of social organization and political power. One factor that may have contributed to Cahokia's decline is internal social and political instability. In conclusion, the rise and fall of Cahokia was a complex process shaped by a combination of environmental, economic, social, and political factors.
