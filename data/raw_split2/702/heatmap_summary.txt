For millennia, agriculture relied on manual labor and animal power, using hand tools or plows pulled by oxen and planting seeds by hand. The late 18th and 19th centuries witnessed the dawn of the agricultural revolution, marked by new technologies and farming practices. The invention of the seed drill by Jethro Tull revolutionized planting. The development of the iron plow and later the steel plow allowed for more efficient tilling of heavier soils, coupled with improved crop rotation techniques and the use of fertilizers, which significantly increased agricultural productivity.

While humans primarily rely on visual and auditory cues for communication, the animal kingdom exhibits diversity in communication methods, with infrasound being a fascinating area of research. Elephants are known for their use of infrasound communication to maintain contact with family groups, warn of danger, and coordinate social behavior. Ongoing research is focused on understanding the full extent of infrasound communication in animals and developing strategies to mitigate the impact of human-generated noise.
