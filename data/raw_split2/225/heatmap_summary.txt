Sleep was once considered a passive state, but modern advancements have revealed its dynamic role in physiological and cognitive functions. The development of EEG was pivotal in identifying sleep stages, and polysomnography allowed for comprehensive analysis. During sleep, the body repairs tissues and replenishes energy stores, and sleep is vital for cognitive function. REM sleep is crucial for memory consolidation, and recent research suggests sleep clears metabolic waste. Celestial navigation relied on measuring angles between celestial bodies and the horizon. The sextant helped determine these angles, and comparing measurements with astronomical tables allowed latitude calculation. Determining longitude was more challenging, requiring precise time difference knowledge. Dead reckoning estimated a vessel's position based on speed, heading, and elapsed time. Ancient navigators also observed wind and currents, studying seabirds and water color. The Polynesians developed a sophisticated system based on star patterns and wave refraction, and the achievements of these mariners are remarkable.
