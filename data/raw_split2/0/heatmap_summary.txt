The Maya civilization, a remarkable achievement in Mesoamerica flourishing from 250 to 900 CE, experienced a mysterious decline, leaving behind abandoned cities and unanswered questions. Not a unified empire, it comprised independent city-states, such as Tikal and Palenque, ruled by kings and engaged in cooperation and warfare. Agriculture was central to the Maya economy, relying on maize and utilizing terracing and irrigation for food production.

Scholars debate the reasons for the Maya collapse during the Terminal Classic period. Environmental degradation, including deforestation and soil erosion leading to agricultural failures and food shortages, is one prominent theory. Another theory emphasizes warfare and political instability, disrupting trade and weakening the ruling elite. Climate change, evidenced by severe droughts impacting agriculture and water resources, is also considered a contributing factor. It is likely that a combination of environmental degradation, warfare, political instability, and climate change caused this decline.
