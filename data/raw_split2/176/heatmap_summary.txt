The Cambrian Explosion, a pivotal event in Earth's history around 541 million years ago, saw a surge in the diversity and complexity of life. Prior to this, life was mostly single-celled or simple multicellular organisms. During this explosion, a wide array of new and diverse animals appeared, many unlike anything seen before. The fossil record from this period reveals the sudden emergence of representatives from major animal phyla like arthropods, mollusks, echinoderms, and chordates. These animals displayed new body plans, features, and behaviors, marking a leap in evolutionary innovation, such as the emergence of hard exoskeletons.

Several factors are proposed to explain this rapid diversification, including a rise in oxygen levels. This provided the energy for complex lifestyles. Another hypothesis focuses on new developmental genes. Additionally, ecological interactions like the evolution of predation played a role.

The Cambrian Explosion laid the foundation for ecosystems and biodiversity. While it saw the rise of many successful forms, it also involved intense competition and extinction, highlighting the selective pressures shaping evolution. One famous fossil site providing evidence of the Cambrian Explosion is the Burgess Shale, offering insights into Cambrian animal anatomy, ecology, and evolution. Despite much research, many questions remain, but studying the Cambrian Explosion provides insight into the processes shaping evolution.
