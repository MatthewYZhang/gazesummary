The evolutionary origins of feathers have been a topic of intense debate. For centuries, the role of feathers in flight, insulation, and display has been recognized. The traditional "flight-first" hypothesis suggests that feathers primarily evolved for aerodynamic purposes. This view posits that early feather-like structures provided a selective advantage by enhancing gliding or flapping capabilities in arboreal dinosaurs. However, this hypothesis faces challenges as many early dinosaurs with feather-like structures lacked flight capabilities.

An alternative hypothesis suggests that feathers initially evolved for insulation. According to this view, early feather-like structures served to trap air and reduce heat loss, providing a selective advantage in cold environments. Another prominent hypothesis suggests that feathers evolved for display and communication, which supported by the fossil record and modern birds with brightly colored feathers. Some researchers propose a multifunctional hypothesis, suggesting that feathers evolved for multiple purposes simultaneously, including insulation, display, and limited aerodynamic benefits. The discovery of fossilized melanosomes within fossilized feathers provided clues about the original color of the feathers, which support the display hypothesis.
