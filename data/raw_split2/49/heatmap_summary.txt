Mycorrhizae, a symbiotic relationship between fungi and plant roots, is vital for forest ecosystems, influencing nutrient cycling and overall forest health. These fungi enhance nutrient uptake for plants by expanding the root's absorptive surface area through extensive hyphal networks. In return, plants provide carbohydrates to the fungi.

Ectomycorrhizae (ECM) are characterized by a fungal sheath enveloping the root tip, with hyphae extending into the soil and penetrating between root cells. They are associated with trees in temperate and boreal forests and can alter forest floor decomposition, nutrient availability, and soil structure. Endomycorrhizae, specifically arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), colonize the roots of most plant species, penetrating directly into root cells to form arbuscules for nutrient exchange. AM fungi also maintain soil structure by producing glomalin.

However, factors like soil fertility and pollutants can influence the effectiveness of the mycorrhizal symbiosis. High levels of soil phosphorus, soil acidification, and heavy metal contamination can negatively impact mycorrhizal fungi, reducing their ability to support plant growth. Conservation efforts must prioritize the maintenance of soil health.
