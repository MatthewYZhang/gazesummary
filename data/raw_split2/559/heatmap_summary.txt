The dramatic decline of Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, is a persistent question in archaeology and anthropology. The remote Polynesian island once supported a thriving population but faced depleted resources and societal collapse by the time Europeans arrived in the 18th century. The extent to which pre-European environmental degradation contributed to this decline remains a subject of intense debate. Jared Diamond, in his book *Collapse*, argues that the Rapa Nui people, through unsustainable resource use, engineered their own downfall. Diamond's thesis posits that the Rapa Nui civilizationâ€™s reliance on the island's forests, particularly its palm trees, led to widespread deforestation. These trees were crucial for constructing canoes used for fishing, transporting and erecting the massive moai statues, and providing fuel for fires. The decline of Rapa Nui was likely the result of a complex interplay of factors, including environmental degradation, external pressures, and climate variability and serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of sustainable resource management.
