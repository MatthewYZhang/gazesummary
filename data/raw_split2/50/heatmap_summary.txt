The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, thrived from around 3300 to 1700 BCE. Characterized by well-planned cities with sophisticated infrastructure like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro featured grid-like street layouts, advanced drainage systems, and standardized brick construction, the civilization eventually declined. These urban centers served as hubs for trade, craft production, and administration. The causes of this decline are not fully understood, but climate change, including prolonged droughts and changes in the course of the Indus River, may have disrupted agricultural production and led to widespread famine.

The Harappan Civilization had a complex social structure, although the exact nature of its organization remains a subject of debate among scholars. One of the most enigmatic aspects of the civilization is its undeciphered script, which has hindered our understanding of their language, history, and beliefs. The civilization's influence remains visible in the art, architecture, and traditions of the Indus Valley region.
