The American chestnut was a vital part of the ecosystem and economy, stretching from Maine to Georgia and west to the Ohio Valley. These magnificent trees could reach heights of over 100 feet and diameters of ten feet or more. The nutritious nuts were a crucial food source for wildlife and livestock. It comprised an estimated 25% of the hardwood forests in its range, influencing the composition and health of the entire forest ecosystem. The rapid growth rate, towering stature, and prolific nut production made it a keystone species, influencing the composition and health of the entire forest ecosystem. The demise of the American chestnut began in the early 1900s, when a fungal pathogen was accidentally introduced from Asia. The loss of the American chestnut had profound ecological and economic consequences. Efforts to restore the American chestnut have been ongoing for decades.
