Coral reefs face unprecedented threats from coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), causing them to turn white. While corals can recover, severe bleaching can lead to coral death and ecosystem collapse. Rising sea temperatures, driven by climate change and human activities, are a primary cause. Other contributing factors include ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing, weakening corals and making them more susceptible to bleaching.

Not all corals are equally susceptible, with some showing resilience to rising temperatures. Research focuses on identifying naturally heat-tolerant species and understanding the mechanisms of coral resilience, potentially leading to strategies for breeding or genetic modification. Actively restoring degraded reefs through transplanting corals grown in nurseries or collected from resilient reefs is another approach. Protecting and managing healthy reefs, along with addressing climate change, is crucial. Addressing climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions is essential for the long-term survival of coral reefs. Combining research, restoration, protection, and climate action offers hope for the survival of these vital ecosystems.
