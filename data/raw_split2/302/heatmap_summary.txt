Fungi are a vast and crucial kingdom of life, distinct from plants and animals. Although mushrooms are the most recognizable form, the majority exist as mycelia networks that permeate soil, wood, and even living organisms. These hidden webs play a vital role in nutrient cycling, decomposition, and plant health, making fungi essential drivers of terrestrial ecosystems. While previously classified within the plant kingdom due to immobility and cell walls, molecular biology revealed fundamental differences. Fungal cell walls, unlike plant cell walls, are composed of chitin, the same material found in insect exoskeletons. Fungi obtain nutrients by absorbing organic matter, setting them apart from plants that use photosynthesis. Fungi also play an important symbiotic relationship with plants, such as Mycorrhizae, where the mycelia extends far beyond the plant's root system, increasing access to water and nutrients and in return, plant provides the fungi with sugars. Fungi also decompose dead organic matter, breaking down complex molecules into simpler compounds that can be reused by other organisms.
