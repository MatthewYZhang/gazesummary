The Cambrian explosion, a significant period about 541 to 485.4 million years ago, saw a dramatic increase in biodiversity and the emergence of most major animal phyla. This event has intrigued scientists for years, as they strive to uncover its underlying causes. During the Cambrian explosion, animals developed hard exoskeletons, segmented bodies, and complex sensory organs, a stark contrast to the earlier Ediacaran period that was characterized by simple, soft-bodied organisms. The Burgess Shale and Chengjiang fossil sites showcase the unique and diverse creatures of this era.

Several factors may have contributed to the Cambrian explosion, including a rise in oxygen levels in the oceans. This rise may have supported the metabolism of larger animals and facilitated the development of collagen, essential for building complex tissues and skeletons. Additionally, the evolution of predation, with the appearance of predators, resulted in the development of defensive adaptations like exoskeletons and spines. Ocean chemistry changes, such as increased calcium carbonate saturation, also played a role, enabling animals to build shells and skeletons, which may have further diversified body plans. The Cambrian explosion established the body plans and ecological relationships that characterize modern animal life.
