Bird migration has fascinated humans for centuries and remains a topic of intense scientific investigation. Birds undertake long-distance movements, often across vast geographical barriers, which present a complex puzzle involving navigation, physiology, and ecological adaptation. While progress has been made, many aspects of this behavior remain enigmatic. Birds often undergo hyperphagia to accumulate fat reserves for their journey, which can constitute a significant proportion of their body weight.

The ecological factors driving bird migration are complex, with resource availability being a primary driver. Birds migrate to exploit seasonal peaks in food abundance, and in winter, they seek areas where food resources are readily available. Competition for resources can also play a role.

Climate change is a significant threat to bird migration, disrupting traditional routes and timing. Some species are adapting by shortening their migrations, while others face declining populations. How birds integrate navigational cues and the genetic and hormonal mechanisms that control migratory behavior remain unanswered questions. Addressing these questions requires continued research involving ecology, physiology, genetics, and climate science to conserve these creatures.
