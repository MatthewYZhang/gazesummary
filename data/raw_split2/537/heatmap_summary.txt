Bird migration, a mass movement of birds, has long fascinated scientists and enthusiasts. Traditional theories propose food availability and temperature changes as the driving forces. Birds instinctively seek environments with food and breeding conditions, but this fails to explain the complexity of bird migration. One intriguing aspect is their navigational ability, which involves using the Earth's magnetic field as an internal compass. This sense is mediated by cells in their eyes or brains and provides a reference point, even under cloudy conditions. Some birds rely on celestial navigation, using the position of the sun, moon, and stars. This requires an understanding of time and space. Others use landmarks, learned through experience, providing a reliable roadmap. However, challenges remain in understanding bird migration, including the energetic demands of long-distance flights, the timing of migration, and the effects of climate change.

Sleepwalking, known as somnambulism, has puzzled researchers for centuries. It occurs during sleep, posing questions about consciousness, motor control, and the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness. Modern research delves into neurological and physiological factors, linking sleepwalking to stages 3 and 4 of NREM sleep. During this phase, the brain inhibits motor activity, but this inhibition may be incomplete in sleepwalkers.
