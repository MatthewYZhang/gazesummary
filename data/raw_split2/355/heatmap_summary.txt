Amphibians, including frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, are experiencing significant decline and extinction rates due to habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and disease. Habitat destruction, driven by human expansion and the conversion of forests, wetlands, and grasslands into agricultural land, urban areas, and industrial zones, poses a major threat, reducing available breeding and foraging grounds and isolating populations. The virulent chytrid fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd), infecting the skin and disrupting water and electrolyte balance, also contributes to amphibian mortality and declines, particularly in tropical regions.

Efforts to conserve amphibians include habitat restoration, captive breeding programs, disease management, and public education, but concerted action is crucial to address the root causes, like habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change, to secure their long-term survival. This decline affects ecosystems, disrupting food webs and the role amphibians play as predators and prey, as well as potentially limiting future scientific research. Agricultural runoff, containing pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, pollutes waterways and soils, directly poisoning amphibians. The future depends on understanding these complex threats and involving governments, scientists, conservation organizations, and the public in global conservation efforts.
