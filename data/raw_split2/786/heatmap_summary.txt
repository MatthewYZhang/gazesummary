The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, flourished in the Indus River Valley from around 3300 to 1700 BCE, rivaling contemporary civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The foundations of Harappan prosperity rested on a fertile agricultural base that was supported by the Indus River and its tributaries, allowing the cultivation of wheat, barley, cotton, and various fruits and vegetables. Evidence suggests that the Harappans developed sophisticated irrigation techniques, including the construction of canals and reservoirs, to maximize agricultural productivity.

Despite its achievements, the Harappan civilization began to decline around 1900 BCE. Environmental changes, shifts in river courses, overexploitation of resources, and external invasions have been proposed to explain this decline. Deforestation, soil erosion, and salinization of agricultural lands may have reduced agricultural productivity, leading to food shortages and economic instability. However, it is more likely that the Indo-Aryan migrations occurred over a longer period and did not directly cause the collapse of the Harappan civilization. Regardless of the specific causes, the decline of the Harappan civilization was a gradual process, leaving behind a legacy of urban planning, technological innovation, and cultural achievement.
