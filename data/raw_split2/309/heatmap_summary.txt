The Cambrian Explosion, a period of significant diversification of life forms, occurred during the Cambrian period, spanning from 541 to 485.4 million years ago. The fossil record provides evidence of this event, with rocks from sites like the Burgess Shale in Canada and the Chengjiang Lagerst√§tte in China containing well-preserved fossils of diverse creatures. These fossils represent nearly all modern animal phyla and various extinct groups.

The Cambrian fauna developed key anatomical features such as hard exoskeletons, segmented bodies, and specialized sensory organs. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the Cambrian Explosion, including increases in oxygen levels and the evolution of biomineralization, offering protection from predators. Ecological factors, such as the emergence of new predators and colonization of new habitats, may have also played a role. The Cambrian Explosion had a lasting impact, shaping the course of evolution. Understanding its causes remains a focus of research, with ongoing discoveries providing new insights into this remarkable period.
