Jazz, a uniquely American art form, originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, blending African musical traditions, European harmonies, and American popular music. Early jazz, often called Dixieland or New Orleans jazz, was marked by collective improvisation. Instruments like the trumpet, clarinet, trombone, piano, banjo, and drums were prominent. Louis Armstrong popularized this energetic style.

Jazz evolved into swing music in the 1930s, which featured larger ensembles and a structured approach to improvisation. The saxophone became central, with danceable rhythms and call-and-response patterns emphasized. Bandleaders like Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman rose to prominence, dominating the airwaves and dance halls. Swing offered an escape during the Great Depression.

The post-World War II era brought bebop, a complex and virtuosic style that reacted against the commercialism of swing. Bebop prioritized artistic expression, emphasizing fast tempos, intricate harmonies, and extended improvisations. Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie were pioneers, pushing the boundaries of improvisation. Contemporary jazz continues to evolve.
