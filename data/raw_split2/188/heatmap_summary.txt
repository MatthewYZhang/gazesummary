The Silk Road, an interconnected network of trade routes, facilitated exchange across Eurasia for over 1,500 years. It played a pivotal role in shaping the cultural, economic, and political landscape of the regions it traversed. The Silk Road's origins trace back to the Han Dynasty when diplomatic missions to secure alliances with nomadic tribes realized the potential for trade. The Han emperors dispatched envoys westward, leading to caravans venturing into Central Asia. Buddhism, originating in India, spread eastward along the Silk Road, establishing a presence in China.

Despite its lasting impact, the Silk Road faced disruption due to the rise and fall of empires, with periods of stability and fragmentation impacting trade flows. The Black Death, a plague that ravaged Europe, spread westward along the route. The decline of the Silk Road began in the 15th century with the rise of maritime trade routes, as European powers sought direct access to Asian goods. Despite its decline, the Silk Road left a lasting legacy, fostering cultural exchange and shaping the political and economic landscape of Eurasia. The concept of the Silk Road has been revived in the 21st century through infrastructure projects aimed at trade and connectivity across Eurasia.
