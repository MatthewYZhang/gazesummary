The late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries marked the rise of coffee culture, shifting from mass-produced coffee to specialty brews, emphasizing the social experience, and establishing coffee shops as central gathering places. In the 1970s and 1980s, higher-quality coffee beans and brewing methods started challenging conventional brands, and by the 1990s, the "coffee shop revolution" transformed cafes into social hubs. Coffee shops became "third places" to socialize, relax, or work remotely, with artisanal coffee appealing to consumers seeking unique experiences. These shops also became popular places for freelancers and students to work remotely with the rise of digital technology. Despite facing criticism for commercialization and environmental impact, coffee culture has transformed coffee consumption and created vibrant social landscapes. It has also influenced consumer behavior regarding quality, sustainability, and ethical consumption.
