Agriculture is the deliberate cultivation of plants and domestication of animals, marking a shift from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities. This led to profound changes in social structures, population density, and technological innovation, with the exact timing and mechanisms of this transition still debated.

The Fertile Crescent is considered the birthplace of agriculture, where humans began to cultivate wild grains and domesticate animals around 10,000-12,000 years ago. Agriculture also arose independently in East Asia, with rice cultivation in the Yangtze River valley, and in Mesoamerica, with the domestication of maize.

Increased food production from agriculture led to population growth, the development of settled villages, and the specialization of labor. This surplus of food allowed for the emergence of social hierarchies and more complex political structures. Agriculture remains crucial for addressing the challenges related to sustainability, climate change, and food security. Understanding its history and evolution is essential for ensuring a sustainable food future.
