The Cambrian explosion, a pivotal moment in Earth's history, occurred roughly 541 to 485.4 million years ago, marking a rapid diversification of multicellular organisms and the emergence of nearly all major animal phyla. Prior to this period, life was primarily microbial, with simple organisms inhabiting the oceans. The Cambrian is defined by the sudden appearance of complex organisms, many with hard skeletons and shells.

This explosion led to the creation of body plans fundamental to modern animal groups. Arthropods and chordates emerged, with early chordates possessing notochords as precursors to vertebral columns. The Cambrian also saw a diversification of mollusks, echinoderms, and other animal phyla, each with unique ecological niches.

The causes of this event have been debated, with hypotheses including increased atmospheric oxygen levels providing energy for larger animals and the evolution of vision driving predator-prey relationships. Changes in ocean chemistry allowing for mineralized skeletons and gene duplication are also possibilities. The Cambrian explosion established basic body plans, altered ecological interactions, and remains a central focus for scientists, providing insights into evolutionary innovation.
