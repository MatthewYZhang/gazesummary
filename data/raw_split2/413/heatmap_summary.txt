The Maya civilization, which flourished from roughly 250 to 900 AD in present-day Mexico and Central America, left behind a legacy of architectural marvels, sophisticated mathematics, and complex hieroglyphic writing. The civilization was not a unified empire, but rather a collection of independent city-states. These city-states, like Tikal and Cop√°n, engaged in trade and warfare, supporting their economy through agriculture, particularly the cultivation of maize, beans, and squash. Advanced agricultural techniques, including terracing, irrigation, and raised fields, allowed them to support a growing population.

The Maya made advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and writing. While their sudden decline remains a subject of debate, understanding the factors of their rise and eventual abandonment provides insights into the dynamics of complex societies. The civilization's legacy is evident in their magnificent ruins, intricate artwork, and intellectual achievements, offering valuable insights into the complexities of ancient civilizations.
