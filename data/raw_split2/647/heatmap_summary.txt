The American chestnut, once a dominant tree species in the eastern United States, made up to 25% of forests from Maine to Georgia. These majestic trees could reach heights of over 100 feet and diameters of 10 feet, living for hundreds of years. They provided valuable timber, wildlife habitat, and a nutritious food source, their annual mast crops of chestnuts being a critical resource for both humans and animals. Native Americans and early European settlers relied heavily on chestnuts as a staple in their diets and economies.

Around 1904, a devastating disease, chestnut blight, began to spread. The blight is caused by a fungal pathogen, *Cryphonectria parasitica*, which was accidentally introduced from Asia, likely on imported chestnut trees. Asian chestnut species had evolved a natural resistance to the fungus, but the American chestnut had no such defenses. Restoration efforts continue through breeding blight-resistant trees and genetic engineering, although the restoration remains a complex and challenging undertaking.
