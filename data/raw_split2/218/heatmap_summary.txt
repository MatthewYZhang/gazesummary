The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is undergoing a period of rapid transformation, impacting various facets of modern society. Its history is marked by both progress and setbacks. Originating in the mid-20th century, Alan Turing's work on computability and machine intelligence led to the Turing Test, a benchmark for evaluating a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence. The Dartmouth Workshop in 1956 is regarded as the birth of AI, with early research focusing on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving. One example, ELIZA, demonstrated the potential for machines to interact with humans.

In 1956, the Dartmouth Workshop, organized by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, is widely considered the birth of AI as a distinct field of study. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning, problem-solving, and natural language processing. 

A new era for AI began with the rise of machine learning, enabling computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, utilizes neural networks to extract complex patterns from data.
