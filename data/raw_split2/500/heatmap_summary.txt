The Sahara Desert, now a vast and arid landscape, was once a lush, green environment with life. This "Green Sahara" phase raises questions about past climate change and future implications. Scientists study orbital variations, monsoonal shifts, and vegetation feedback, primary drivers being changes in Earth's orbit and axial tilt. These fluctuations, known as Milankovitch cycles, altered the distribution of solar radiation, intensified the African monsoon, and transformed the Sahara into a savannah-like landscape. Vegetation also played a crucial role, reducing surface albedo and enhancing rainfall. Abrupt climate shifts eventually led to desertification.

Studying the Green Sahara informs understanding of modern climate change and may predict how the region will respond to rising temperatures. Some climate models suggest increased rainfall in the Sahara, though a full return to a "Green Sahara" is unlikely. Even a modest increase in precipitation could have ecological and societal consequences.
