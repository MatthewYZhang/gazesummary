Collective memory is a shared pool of knowledge and recollections held by a group, playing a crucial role in shaping identity, culture, and social cohesion. Unlike individual memory, collective memory is intersubjective, constructed, and maintained through social interactions, rituals, and narratives. It is an active process of selecting, interpreting, and re-interpreting events and figures to serve present needs and values, fostering a sense of national unity and pride, but it can also be exclusionary, marginalizing, or omitting experiences of certain groups. One of the primary functions is creating a sense of belonging and shared identity through common experiences and heroes. It is also intertwined with power, where those controlling dominant narratives wield considerable influence. Lastly, the study of collective memory is a multidisciplinary field, drawing insights from various disciplines to understand its formation, transmission, and transformation, as well as its impact on social behavior and political attitudes.
