Coffee's journey from a regional drink to a global phenomenon involves understanding its production, distribution, and consumption spaces. Originating in Ethiopia and primarily consumed in the Islamic world, coffee houses, known as "qahveh khaneh," emerged in the 15th century as centers of social and intellectual life. The spread to Europe in the 17th century, although initially resisted, led to coffee houses becoming important gathering places, influencing financial markets, insurance, and political discussions. The 20th century brought transformations, including instant coffee, vacuum-packed coffee and the emergence of large chains like Starbucks that revolutionized marketing and transformed coffee into a lifestyle experience. The rise of coffee culture is a multifaceted phenomenon, with coffee transforming social, economic, and cultural landscapes. The origins in Ethiopian cultivation, the exploitative labor practices of plantations, and the marketing strategies of large chains all contributed to the evolution of coffee into a ubiquitous and culturally significant beverage today.
