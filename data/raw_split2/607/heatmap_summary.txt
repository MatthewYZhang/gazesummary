Cahokia, a major Mississippian culture center near Collinsville, Illinois, thrived in the Mississippi River Valley from around 800 to 1400 CE. At its peak around 1100 CE, the city had an estimated population of 10,000 to 20,000. The fertile floodplain and advanced agricultural techniques, including intensive farming methods, were key to Cahokia's success. The Mississippians were skilled farmers, cultivating maize, beans, squash, and other crops. The abundance of food resources allowed for specialization of labor and the development of a complex social hierarchy.

Cahokia was organized with residential areas, ceremonial plazas, and craft zones, dotted with earthen mounds. Cahokia was a major trade center, exchanging goods throughout the Mississippi River Valley, with artifacts found hundreds of miles away. The social structure of Cahokia was hierarchical, with a clear distinction between the elite and commoners. After centuries of prosperity, Cahokia declined in the 13th century due to environmental degradation. The reasons for its decline are still debated, with theories ranging from environmental factors, such as soil exhaustion and climate change, to social and political unrest.
