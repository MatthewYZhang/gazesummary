Caves, captivating voids in Earth's crust, provide insights into geological processes, hydrological systems, and Earth's history. Understanding them requires geology, hydrology, and geochemistry. Most caves form by dissolution in soluble rocks like limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. Acidic rainwater percolates through cracks, dissolving rock and creating passageways. Geological conditions like rock type, fractures, and groundwater flow determine cave size and shape. Caves act as groundwater conduits, and understanding their hydrological dynamics is crucial for managing water resources. Pollution can contaminate groundwater and harm cave-dwelling organisms, and conservation is essential to protect caves. Over-exploration and vandalism can damage speleothems and disrupt the delicate balance of the cave environment.
