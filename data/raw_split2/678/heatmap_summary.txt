Bird migration is a remarkable phenomenon that involves seasonal movements from breeding to non-breeding areas, presenting significant physiological challenges. While the reason for migration, exploiting seasonal resources, is understood, the exact mechanisms of how birds navigate remain a scientific puzzle. Early theories focused on celestial cues, such as the sun and stars, but these alone cannot explain the navigational precision observed, especially under cloudy conditions.

More recent research highlights the crucial role of Earth's magnetic field. Birds possess receptors, likely in their eyes or inner ears, to detect the direction, angle, and intensity of the magnetic field, acting as an internal compass and map. Studies show that altered magnetic fields can disorient birds and change their migratory paths. Moreover, researchers propose that birds use olfactory landscapes and infrasound as additional environmental cues, suggesting that a combination of sensory inputs creates a reliable navigation system.

Additionally, advancements in technology, such as miniature GPS trackers and satellite transmitters, have revolutionized bird migration studies. These tools enable scientists to track bird movements with unprecedented accuracy, providing valuable data on migration patterns and influencing factors. This information is vital for conservation efforts, as migratory birds face numerous threats, including habitat loss and climate change. The ongoing research combines traditional observation with cutting-edge technologies to reveal the complex interactions enabling bird navigation.
