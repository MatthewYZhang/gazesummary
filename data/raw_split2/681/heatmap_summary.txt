The bald eagle has long been a symbol in North American culture, but its populations declined dramatically in the 20th century due to human activities. Historically, bald eagles thrived across North America, inhabiting coastal areas, large lakes, and rivers, consuming fish, waterfowl, small mammals, and carrion. The decline began in the mid-19th century with habitat loss, hunting, and the use of DDT, leading to eggshell thinning and reproductive failure. The plight of the bald eagle led to the Bald Eagle Protection Act in 1940 and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ban on DDT in 1972. These actions and other intensive conservation efforts marked the beginning of the bald eagle's remarkable recovery, with populations rebounding as DDT levels declined. By 2007, the bald eagle was officially removed from the list of threatened and endangered species. The current population is now over 10,000 nesting pairs.
