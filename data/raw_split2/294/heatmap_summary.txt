The assumption that cooperative hunting in wolves is a straightforward evolutionary advantage is an oversimplification. Canid species display a range of hunting approaches, from solitary to coordinated pack hunts, influenced by the interplay of costs and benefits in response to environmental pressures. 

Group living presents challenges, including energy consumption for establishing social hierarchies and the necessity for deference signaling. Subordinate wolves may experience reduced foraging time and limited access to prime hunting spots, potentially reducing individual food intake. Despite these drawbacks, wolves hunt in packs for taking down larger, more dangerous prey and providing a reliable food supply, particularly in harsh environments where smaller prey is scarce.

Cooperative hunting can provide a coordinated defense, deter competitors, and protect territories. Additionally, division of labor allows some wolves to hunt while others guard pups. The evolution of cooperative hunting in wolves involves ongoing adaptation and adjustment, and is determined by the balance between the challenges of group living and the rewards of coordinated effort.
