The article begins by introducing Impressionism and Post-Impressionism as case studies in the evolution of artistic styles, noting how artistic expression was historically bound by patronage and conventions, with artists primarily serving as recorders. The 19th century marked a shift due to industrialization, the rise of the middle class, and scientific discoveries, fostering experimentation in the arts. The Impressionist movement, emerging in France in the 1860s, reacted against academic traditions by capturing fleeting sensory experiences, especially the effects of light and atmosphere. Artists like Claude Monet abandoned traditional techniques, using visible brushstrokes and pure color to depict everyday scenes. Post-Impressionist artists, including Van Gogh and CÃ©zanne, built on Impressionist foundations but pushed further into emotional and symbolic content, rejecting the focus on fleeting moments for inner visions and personal expression. The article concludes that the impact of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism on modern art is undeniable, paving the way for abstract movements through subjective perception, emotional expression, and experimentation.

The article also discusses glaciers as powerful agents in shaping landscapes. Over millennia, they sculpt dramatic geological features. Glaciers primarily erode landscapes through abrasion and plucking, with the rate of erosion depending on ice thickness, velocity, bedrock geology, and debris. Glacial meltwater also plays a significant role. Understanding glacial processes is crucial for interpreting Earth's history and predicting future changes as glaciers melt at an accelerated rate due to rising temperatures.
