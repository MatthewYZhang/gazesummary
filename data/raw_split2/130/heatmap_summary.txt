Ecosystems are delicately balanced webs of interacting organisms. The introduction of invasive species, which are non-native organisms, can disrupt this equilibrium, causing harm to the environment, economy, and human health. Human activities, such as international trade and travel, exacerbate the spread of invasive species. Invasive species thrive due to the lack of natural predators and competitors, allowing them to reproduce rapidly and outcompete native species for resources. The consequences include the decline of native species, habitat alteration, and disruption of ecosystem services like pollination.

The consequences of invasive species can be devastating, leading to the decline or extinction of native species, alteration of habitat structure and function, and disruption of ecosystem services. Invasive species can also alter habitat structure and function. Controlling and managing invasive species requires a multifaceted approach, with prevention being the most effective strategy. This involves stricter border controls and public awareness campaigns.
