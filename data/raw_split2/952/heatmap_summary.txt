The introduction of artificial light at night (ALAN) has ecological impacts such as altered animal behavior, plant physiology, and ecosystem dynamics. The degree of alteration depends on factors like light intensity, habitat, and time of year. A major consequence of ALAN is the disruption of biological rhythms, as many organisms have evolved internal clocks synchronized to daylight and darkness. Disrupted rhythms lead to negative consequences, such as disorienting migratory birds and interfering with nocturnal animal activities. Additionally, ALAN fundamentally alters the landscape, masking natural light cues and changing species interactions. It can also suppress melatonin production, leading to potential health problems.

The widespread use of antibiotics is a significant cause of bacterial resistance. Antibiotics kill off non-resistant bacteria, and bacteria are more likely to pass on resistant genes, resulting in increased resistance over time. Bacteria can also exchange genes, leading to rapid resistance, which is connected to human antibiotic usage. Studies show that limited antibiotic access leads to low resistance, and reduced antibiotic usage can lower resistance rates.
