The arid landscapes of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico are home to a diverse array of desert fish that thrive in isolated springs, shallow pools, and streams. These fish belong to the family Cyprinodontidae, known as pupfishes and killifishes, and possess a remarkable tolerance to extreme temperatures, fluctuating water levels, and high salinity. Geological history has also shaped the evolution of these desert fish, as wetter climates and interconnected river systems gave way to isolated pockets of water, leading to genetic divergence and the formation of endemic species.

However, these adaptations now make them vulnerable to human impacts, due to rapid population growth, agricultural development, and increased demand for water resources. Water diversion for irrigation and urban use, as well as groundwater pumping, reduce habitat for desert fish, and introduced species pose further threats by competing for resources and altering the habitat. Climate change presents another challenge, as rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns threaten to reduce habitat and increase drought events, Conservation efforts are underway to protect desert fish and their habitats through habitat restoration, water management, and public awareness.
