Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, flourished from 1050 to 1350 CE as the largest Mississippian urban center, giving insights into the society's dynamics. The defining feature is its monumental earthworks, with Monks Mound, the largest in North America, dominating the landscape, rising over 100 feet and covering 14 acres, likely serving as a platform for a chief's residence or a temple, symbolizing authority. Other mounds were used for elite residences, burials, and astronomical observatories. Cahokia's rise was fueled by its strategic river confluence location and maize agriculture, supporting a large population and craft industries. The Cahokians adopted a highly productive form of maize agriculture, allowing them to support a large and densely populated urban center. It eventually declined around 1350 CE for complex reasons like environmental factors and social unrest but left a legacy of ingenuity.
