The extinction of megafauna during the late Pleistocene epoch has captivated scientists. Climate change is a prevailing hypothesis, with glacial cycles causing shifts in temperature and vegetation patterns, potentially stressing megafauna populations by disrupting habitats and limiting food access. However, the climate change theory alone fails to fully explain the selective nature of these extinctions. The timing of extinctions doesn't always align with periods of rapid climate change. The relative importance of human activity is also considered, with the spread of *Homo sapiens* coinciding with megafauna extinctions. Early humans, equipped with hunting techniques, may have driven vulnerable species to extinction through overhunting.

Proponents of the "overkill hypothesis" point to evidence of human hunting, like in Australia where megafaunal species disappeared following human arrival. However, the overkill hypothesis remains controversial. Climate change and human activity may have acted synergistically to drive megafauna extinctions. Other factors, like disease outbreaks, and competition with introduced species could have contributed to the extinctions. Ultimately, future research, incorporating new archaeological discoveries, will be crucial for unraveling the puzzle.
