Cartography, the art and science of mapmaking, has been pivotal throughout human civilization for navigation, exploration, and resource management. Early maps were practical tools for navigation and territorial control. Ancient Egyptians mapped the Nile for surveying and taxation, while Babylonians created clay tablet maps of their known world centered around Babylon. The Greeks applied mathematical and astronomical principles to cartography, with Anaximander credited for creating one of the first world maps. Ptolemy's system of map projection, latitude, and longitude greatly influenced future mapmaking. The Middle Ages saw a decline in scientific cartography in Europe, but Islamic scholars preserved Greek knowledge. The Age of Exploration brought a resurgence, leading to more accurate maps, the printing press allowed for mass production. The digital revolution in the 20th and 21st centuries introduced Geographic Information Systems (GIS), satellite imagery, and online platforms like Google Maps, transforming map accessibility. Today, cartography evolves to address global challenges through data analytics, AI, and virtual reality.
