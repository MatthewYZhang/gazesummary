Cahokia, the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, flourished from around 1050 to 1350 CE and boasted a population rivaling contemporary European cities. Its impressive architecture, sophisticated social organization, and trade networks indicated a complex society. However, Cahokia was ultimately abandoned, leaving a legacy shrouded in mystery.

The city's most striking feature was its monumental earthworks, including Monks Mound, the largest earthen structure in North America, which served as a platform for a temple or residence. Surrounding Monks Mound were other mounds used for residential, ceremonial, and burial purposes. These mounds represented an investment of labor and the organizational capabilities of Cahokian society.

Cahokia's religious beliefs were intertwined with agriculture and the natural world, with the city's layout potentially reflecting astronomical alignments. Despite its abandonment, Cahokia left a lasting legacy, influencing other Mississippian centers and providing insights into pre-Columbian societies. The complex interplay of factors led to its rise and fall and studying Cahokia provides valuable insights into the dynamics of pre-Columbian societies and the challenges they faced in adapting to changing environmental and social conditions.
