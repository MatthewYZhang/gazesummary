Foraging, the act of searching for and obtaining food, is a fundamental behavior driving survival and reproduction. Animals employ diverse strategies to find food, reflecting challenges and opportunities in their environments. One key concept is optimal foraging theory, where animals maximize energy intake while minimizing costs, such as energy expended in searching and predation risks. A predator might choose to hunt prey that are relatively easy to catch, even if they are not the most nutritious, to reduce the risk of injury during the hunt. Animals use various cues, including visual, olfactory, and auditory, to locate food. 

Food distribution influences foraging strategies. Systematic searches are used when food is patchy or scarce, while random foraging occurs when food is abundant and evenly distributed. Social factors, like group foraging, can increase efficiency and reduce predation risk. Group foraging can also lead to competition for food resources, especially when food is limited. The impact of human presence on foraging patterns has become a major concern in wildlife management. For example, some urban animals have learned to exploit human food sources. Understanding these adaptations is essential for mitigating the negative impacts of human activities on animal populations and ensuring their long-term survival.
