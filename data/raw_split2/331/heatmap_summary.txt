Artificial light at night is an increasingly pervasive form of pollution, impacting a wide range of wildlife by altering natural behaviors, physiological processes, and even entire ecosystems. One significant impact is its effect on animal navigation. Nocturnal animals, including migratory birds and sea turtles, rely on natural light cues to navigate, and artificial lights can disorient them. Migratory birds attracted to brightly lit urban areas may become trapped, collide with buildings, or exhaust themselves. Similarly, newly hatched sea turtles guided to the ocean by faint light can become disoriented by artificial lights on shore. ALAN can also disrupt circadian rhythms, affecting sleep-wake cycles, hormone production, and reproductive behavior. The effects extend to marine ecosystems, where artificial lights can penetrate shallow waters, affecting the behavior of plankton, fish, and invertebrates. Reducing light intensity and using amber or red-toned lights can minimize the impact on animals. A multifaceted approach involving scientists, policymakers, and the public is needed to address ALAN, including research, mitigation strategies, regulations, and public awareness campaigns to encourage responsible lighting practices.
