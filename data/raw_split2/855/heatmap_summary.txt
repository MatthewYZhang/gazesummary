Bird migration, a captivating phenomenon, is driven by a complex interplay of factors. Early theories proposed that environmental pressures, particularly the availability of food and nesting sites, dictate migratory patterns. In colder regions, birds migrate south to find abundant food during harsh winters, returning north in spring to exploit insect life and longer daylight hours for raising young.

Birds also possess remarkable navigational abilities, including an internal compass that allows them to sense Earth's magnetic field, as well as celestial navigation using the sun, moon, and stars. Visual landmarks are crucial for navigation, with birds learning and remembering coastlines, mountain ranges, and river valleys as guideposts. The role of olfaction in bird migration is also intriguing, with evidence suggesting some species use olfactory cues to locate distant breeding colonies or food sources. However, climate change poses increasing threats to bird migration by disrupting food availability and nesting conditions.
