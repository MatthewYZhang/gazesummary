Jazz, a genre born from the fusion of African and European musical traditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, represents one of America's most significant contributions to global culture, with its evolution being a rich tapestry woven with improvisation, syncopation, and soulful expression. The roots of jazz lie in the African American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, where enslaved Africans brought a vibrant musical heritage, including complex rhythms, call-and-response patterns, and vocal styles like the blues, blending with European instruments and musical forms. Early jazz, or "Dixieland," was characterized by collective improvisation, with figures like Buddy Bolden and Louis Armstrong shaping the genre's foundational elements.

The 1920s saw the rapid spread of jazz throughout the United States, with the rise of swing music, characterized by a smoother rhythm and larger ensembles.  Swing emphasized written arrangements but allowed for improvisation, particularly in solos. The post-World War II era brought bebop, a reaction against the commercialism of swing, defined by rapid tempos, intricate harmonies, and virtuosic soloing, with figures like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie pushing jazz boundaries. Later, jazz continued to evolve in diverse directions, including fusion.
