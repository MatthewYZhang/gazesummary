Cahokia, an influential urban center of the Mississippian culture, thrived from 800 to 1600 CE, reaching its peak around 1100 CE. Its population was similar to London at the time, and its society was complex. The city's success relied on its fertile floodplain, allowing for intensive maize agriculture and advanced farming techniques, leading to an agricultural surplus that supported a large population and specialized workforce. This in turn enabled the construction of monumental earthworks.

The most iconic structure was Monks Mound, the largest pre-Columbian earthwork in North America, which likely served as the residence of the city's paramount chief. Cahokia's society had a clear hierarchy, with the elite controlling resources, labor, and religious life. Though the decline remains a mystery, environmental factors, overpopulation, political conflicts, external pressures, and climate change are all proposed reasons.

Concrete, a versatile composite material, has revolutionized architecture due to its durability and affordability. The key ingredient is cement, which undergoes hydration when mixed with water, binding the aggregate together. Its compressive strength is a valuable property, with steel reinforcement bars often used to overcome its weakness in tension. Concrete is cast into various shapes, with innovative types being developed to be more sustainable and resilient.

Hibernation, a state of dormancy characterized by reduced body temperature and metabolic rate, is a remarkable physiological adaptation. It is triggered by environmental cues and regulated by complex mechanisms. Animals experience decreased heart and breathing rates. Arousals occur during these torpor periods and are important for immune function, tissue repair, and waste elimination. Animals accumulate fat reserves and undergo changes to cope with prolonged inactivity. Bears undergo winter sleep while bats and hedgehogs are true hibernators, and studying hibernation has implications for medicine, conservation, and space exploration.
