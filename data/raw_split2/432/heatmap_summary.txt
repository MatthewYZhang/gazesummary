Coral atolls, ring-shaped islands found in tropical oceans, are biologically diverse ecosystems that hold a story of geological evolution driven by volcanic activity, coral growth, and sea-level changes. Darwin proposed that atoll formation relates to volcanic islands and coral reef development. Initially, underwater volcanic eruptions form islands colonized by corals, gradually building a fringing reef.

Over time, the volcanic island may subside, causing the coral reef to grow upwards to maintain its position for photosynthesis. The fringing reef transforms into a barrier reef, separated from the shrinking volcanic island by a lagoon. If the volcanic island submerges, the coral reef continues its upward growth, forming an atoll surrounding a central lagoon, which is relatively shallow.

The vegetation on these islands is adapted to the harsh conditions of high salinity and limited freshwater availability. Atolls support a remarkable biodiversity. They face threats from pollution, overfishing, and climate change, which can cause coral bleaching and inhibit coral growth. Conservation efforts are essential to protect these ecosystems.
