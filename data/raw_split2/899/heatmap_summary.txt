The ancient Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica for centuries, leaving behind magnificent cities and sophisticated knowledge. However, around the 9th century CE, a dramatic decline occurred, leading to the abandonment of major urban centers in the southern lowlands. The Maya collapse remains a historical mystery. Scholars propose various factors, including environmental degradation, with a focus on deforestation driven by the need for firewood, construction materials, and agricultural land. This led to soil erosion and decreased rainfall, potentially resulting in prolonged droughts, disrupted agriculture, and famine. Overpopulation exacerbated environmental problems, potentially leading to conflicts. Political instability and warfare also contributed as constant warfare diverted resources from infrastructure.
