Aqueducts, artificial channels conveying water from a source to a distribution point, have significantly advanced urban development, agriculture, and societal well-being throughout history. The earliest aqueducts were simple open-air channels used for crop irrigation in regions with limited rainfall. As cities expanded, the need for reliable and clean water spurred innovations in aqueduct technology.

The Roman aqueducts, known for their scale, engineering, and longevity, demonstrate the ingenuity of Roman engineers and employed sophisticated methods. The water delivered by these aqueducts contributed significantly to public health and sanitation. The construction of aqueducts often involved significant social and economic implications. These systems required substantial investment and labor, and the control of water resources facilitated by aqueducts could lead to power imbalances.

Modern aqueducts continue to supply water to urban and agricultural areas, but they are often technologically advanced. Aqueducts have allowed for the development of agriculture and supported urban growth and societal well-being. However, these structures can also have environmental consequences, and their planning must prioritize sustainable water management practices.
