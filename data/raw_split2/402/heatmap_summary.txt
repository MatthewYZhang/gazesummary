Glaciers, as powerful landscape modifiers, carve, erode, and deposit sediment, leaving a mark on Earth's surface and shaping environments globally. Glaciers form where snowfall exceeds snowmelt, leading to snow accumulation and compression into dense glacial ice. As ice mass grows, gravity pulls it downslope, creating erosion and deposition. Glacial erosion stems from plucking, where meltwater seeps into cracks in bedrock and freezes, wedging apart rock fragments, and abrasion, involving the grinding of bedrock by embedded rock fragments. Plucking and abrasion combine to create U-shaped valleys with broad, flat floors and steep walls. They also form Cirques and ArÃªtes. Glaciers transport sediment and deposit till, creating depositional landforms such as moraines. Meltwater provides freshwater for ecosystems, but climate change is causing glaciers to melt, which leads to concerns about water availability, sea-level rise, and the disruption of glacial ecosystems.
