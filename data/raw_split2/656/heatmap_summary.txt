Songbirds, making up about half of the world's bird species, can learn and change their vocalizations, a rare trait that contributes to song diversity. The study of these songs provides insights into vocal learning, communication, and the evolution of complex behaviors.  Unlike the innate vocalizations of other animals, songbirds learn their songs in a manner similar to human language acquisition. Young birds learn by listening and imitating adult songs during a critical period. There are sensitive periods for learning and it is much harder to learn songs once this period is missed.  Songbirds are divided into open-ended learners and age-limited learners. The evolution of song complexity is influenced by sexual selection and environmental factors. Dialects in bird songs are also seen across geographic regions. Scientists are researching the mechanisms by which birds learn, the genetics behind song development, and the ecological factors that drive song diversification.
