Plant-based diets are gaining popularity due to a confluence of factors, including growing awareness of health implications, environmental concerns, and ethical considerations. A primary motivator is the perceived health benefits, with studies linking diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains to a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer, as plant-based diets are typically lower in saturated fat and cholesterol while being higher in fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

The food industry has responded to this demand by developing a wide range of plant-based products. In conclusion, the trend towards plant-based eating is likely to continue as more individuals become aware of the potential benefits and the food industry responds with accessible plant-based options.
