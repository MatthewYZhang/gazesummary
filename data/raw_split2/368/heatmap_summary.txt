Aquaponics is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, creating a symbiotic ecosystem where fish and plants benefit each other. Ancient civilizations like the Aztecs and Egyptians practiced similar methods of integrated aquaculture and plant cultivation. The Aztecs built chinampas, which are artificial islands in shallow lakebeds, where they cultivated crops alongside fish and aquatic life. The nutrient cycle is crucial in aquaponics, with fish waste converted into nutrients for plants, which then filter the water for the fish. The formalization of aquaponics as a distinct field emerged in the 1970s and Dr. James Rakocy pioneered recirculating aquaculture systems coupled with hydroponics. Aquaponics requires understanding aquaculture and hydroponics and faces challenges like initial costs, monitoring, and maintenance. Despite its challenges, aquaponics is expanding due to interest in sustainable food production.
