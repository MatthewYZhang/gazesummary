The Maya civilization, known for its architecture, calendar system, and writing, flourished in Mesoamerica for over 1,500 years. From 250 AD to 900 AD, the Classic Maya period saw the rise of powerful city-states across present-day Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. These city-states engaged in trade, warfare, and ceremonies. However, by the 10th century, many major Maya centers experienced a decline. This collapse remains a mystery.

Several factors, including environmental, social, and political pressures, likely contributed to the Maya decline. One theory revolves around environmental change, particularly extended droughts. Deforestation and soil erosion could have exacerbated these droughts, impacting agricultural productivity and water resources, and leading to food shortages and the abandonment of settlements.

However, the drought theory alone cannot fully explain the collapse. Social and political factors, such as increased warfare between city-states, also played a role. Warfare disrupted trade routes and destabilized political systems. Additionally, social inequality and overpopulation may have contributed to the decline, leading to competition for resources and social unrest. Disease outbreaks may have also contributed to the Maya decline. The collapse was likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors, including environmental change, warfare, social inequality, overpopulation, and disease.
