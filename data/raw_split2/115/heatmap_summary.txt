Invasive species, or non-native organisms introduced outside their natural range, are increasingly spread through human activities like global trade and travel, causing ecological and economic disruptions. These species proliferate rapidly, often lacking predators, outcompeting native species, and altering ecosystems, which results in significant economic losses. Their introduction happens through ballast water from ships and intentional or unintentional pathways.

The ecological consequences of these species are far-reaching, disrupting food webs and altering habitat structure, as exemplified by the brown tree snake in Guam, which decimated native bird populations, and the zebra mussel in the Great Lakes, which clogged water intake pipes. Invasive plants, like Kudzu and Purple loosestrife, also devastate ecosystems by outcompeting native species, altering nutrient cycles, and reducing biodiversity. Managing invasive species requires a multi-faceted approach, including prevention, early detection, rapid response, and control efforts, such as pesticides and biological control agents. International cooperation is essential to prevent and control their global spread.
