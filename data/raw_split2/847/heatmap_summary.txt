Cahokia, situated in present-day Illinois, thrived as the largest and most influential urban center of the Mississippian culture from approximately 800 to 1600 CE, with its peak around 1050-1150 CE. Its monumental earthen mounds, meticulously planned layout, and complex social organization distinguished the city. However, Cahokia experienced a dramatic decline and eventual abandonment leading up to European contact.

One prominent hypothesis for Cahokia's rise attributes its success to agricultural innovation, particularly the adoption of a highly productive variety of maize (corn), which enabled a significant surplus of food, supported a larger population, and freed individuals to specialize in crafting, construction, and governance. The city's strategic location at the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers also contributed, providing access to trade networks and resources. Other theories suggest that the emergence of a powerful elite class played a key role in organizing the labor force.

The decline of Cahokia was likely a complex process resulting from the interplay of multiple factors, including environmental degradation, social unrest, economic shifts, and climatic changes. These include deforestation, the decline of trade networks, and shifting climatic patterns. Further research continues to shed light on the rise and fall of this civilization.
