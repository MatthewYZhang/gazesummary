Coral reefs are among the most diverse and productive ecosystems, providing essential habitat for marine life and supporting human communities through fisheries and tourism. They are primarily found in warm, shallow tropical and subtropical waters. These reefs, built by coral polyps, secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton, which over time, accumulates into the complex structures we recognize. Reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, microscopic algae that provide them with essential nutrients through photosynthesis.

However, coral reefs face threats from climate change, pollution, and destructive fishing practices. Climate change causes coral bleaching, where corals expel zooxanthellae due to rising ocean temperatures, losing their color and energy source, leading to degradation. Pollution from land-based sources and destructive fishing practices further harm coral reefs. Efforts to mitigate climate change, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable fishing practices are crucial for the future of coral reefs. Additionally, coral reef restoration projects and research into bleaching-resistant coral varieties are underway to enhance their resilience.
