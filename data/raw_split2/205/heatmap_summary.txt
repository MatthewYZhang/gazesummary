Artificial light, while bringing convenience and productivity, has potential detrimental effects on human health. The human body operates on a circadian rhythm, which is primarily regulated by exposure to sunlight and governs various physiological processes. Artificial light, especially blue light from electronic devices, disrupts this rhythm and suppresses the production of melatonin, leading to sleep difficulties and deprivation. Reduced melatonin levels contribute to difficulties falling asleep, fragmented sleep, and overall sleep deprivation.

Chronic sleep disruption has been linked to health problems, like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, and also impairs cognitive function. Artificial light at night is associated with an increased risk of depression and anxiety disorders. The disruption of the circadian rhythm and the suppression of melatonin can negatively affect mood regulation and contribute to emotional instability.

To mitigate these negative effects, individuals can reduce exposure to blue light by using filters, dimming screens, and avoiding screen time before bed. Communities can implement strategies to reduce light pollution, such as using shielded outdoor lighting fixtures, reducing unnecessary lighting, and promoting responsible lighting practices. A balanced approach to lighting is essential for navigating the complexities of our illuminated world.
