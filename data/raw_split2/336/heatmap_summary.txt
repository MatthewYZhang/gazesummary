Mycorrhizae are symbiotic relationships between fungi and plant roots, enhancing nutrient uptake for the plant in exchange for carbohydrates. This association is crucial in forests where nutrient limitations constrain plant growth. Mycorrhizal fungi extend plant root systems with vast hyphae networks, increasing access to phosphorus, nitrogen, and micronutrients, made accessible by fungal enzymes.  There are two main types: ectomycorrhizae, which form sheaths around root tips and are associated with trees in temperate forests, and endomycorrhizae (AM), which penetrate root cells and are associated with most plant species. The distribution and diversity of mycorrhizal fungi are influenced by soil type, pH, moisture, and host plants. Mycorrhizae enhance plant growth, increase resistance to drought, and improve soil structure, playing a critical role in nutrient cycling and connecting plants. Mycorrhizae enhance carbon sequestration in soils and can improve plant resilience to drought.  However, mycorrhizal fungi can act as pathogens or parasites under stress and may facilitate the spread of invasive species. Understanding these interactions is essential for sustainable forest management.
