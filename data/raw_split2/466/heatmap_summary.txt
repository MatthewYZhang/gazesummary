Global tourism has rapidly expanded since the latter half of the 20th century, fueled by several converging factors. Advances in transportation, particularly the advent of jet air travel, have revolutionized the industry by shrinking travel times and reducing costs. This, coupled with the growth of budget airlines and airport infrastructure, has made air travel more accessible. In addition, rising levels of affluence have increased disposable income for leisure activities, including travel, with emerging economies like China and India seeing a surge in outbound tourism. The proliferation of information and communication technologies, especially the internet, has transformed the tourism industry. Online travel agencies, booking platforms, and review sites have facilitated travel planning, while social media has become a powerful tool for promoting destinations and influencing travel trends. The future of global tourism will depend on sustainable practices and technological advances.
