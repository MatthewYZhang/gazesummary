Migration, the seasonal movement of animals from one region to another, is a phenomenon especially notable in birds. Birds embark on journeys that can span thousands of miles, navigating to reach breeding or wintering grounds, and biologists are interested in the mechanisms, drivers, and history behind this behavior.

The origins of bird migration are not fully understood, but several hypotheses exist. One theory suggests that migration evolved gradually, with movements expanding over time in response to changes in food availability or temperature, leading to long-distance migrations. Another hypothesis emphasizes the role of climate change; the Pleistocene epoch's ice ages altered habitat distribution, forcing birds to shift ranges. This favored individuals able to move long distances to exploit new resources.

Routes and timing are not random but influenced by factors, including genetics, learning, and environmental cues. Birds may have a migratory program encoded in their genes. Protecting breeding grounds, wintering areas, and stopover sites is essential for the long-term survival of migratory bird populations.
