Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are diverse and valuable ecosystems that provide habitat, food, and protection for marine life. They are also vital to human populations, supporting fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection. These underwater structures are built by coral polyps, invertebrates related to jellyfish and sea anemones, which secrete hard calcium carbonate skeletons. Microscopic algae called zooxanthellae live within the tissues of coral polyps in a symbiotic relationship, providing the coral with food and energy through photosynthesis.

Coral reefs are found primarily in warm, shallow waters of tropical and subtropical regions. However, coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats such as climate change, which causes coral bleaching and ocean acidification, pollution from land-based sources, and destructive fishing practices. Efforts to protect and restore coral reefs include reducing carbon emissions, implementing stricter regulations on pollution and fishing, and actively restoring damaged reefs. The future of coral reefs depends on our ability to address these threats, ensuring these vital ecosystems continue to thrive.
