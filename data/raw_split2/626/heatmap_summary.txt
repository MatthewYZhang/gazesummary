The domestication of the horse is a pivotal moment in history, altering transportation, agriculture, warfare, and cultural exchange. Initial taming and breeding of horses are subject to ongoing research, yet archaeological evidence and genetic studies offer valuable insights. The horse was first domesticated in the Eurasian Steppe, characterized by open terrain and nomadic cultures, and the most likely site of domestication is the Botai culture of present-day Kazakhstan around 3500 BCE. Archaeological findings reveal evidence of horse corrals and the use of horse milk. In the ancient Near East, horses were associated with royalty, and in the Americas, horses were introduced by European colonizers and quickly became an integral part of Native American cultures. The domestication of the horse has ecological consequences, such as altering plant communities, but it also stands as a remarkable achievement in human history. The horse has become a symbol of freedom, power, and companionship, deeply intertwined with human culture and identity.
