Artificial light at night is an increasing environmental alteration that stems from outdoor lighting and affects ecosystems and human health. Migratory birds use celestial cues for navigation, and ALAN can disorient them, leading to collisions with buildings. Sea turtle hatchlings are drawn inland by artificial lights, leading to exhaustion. Nocturnal insects are attracted to artificial lights, which can disrupt their mating patterns and increase their vulnerability to predators, affecting the food web and pollination.

Light exposure at night suppresses melatonin production, which has been linked to sleep disorders and increased cancer risk. ALAN can interfere with human circadian rhythms, associated with increased risk of mood disorders and impaired cognitive function. Blue light from electronic devices at night can further suppress melatonin production.

Addressing ALAN requires a multifaceted approach with technological solutions such as shielded light fixtures, and switching to warmer color temperatures for LED lights can minimize the impacts on melatonin production. Policy interventions regulating outdoor lighting can help reduce light pollution. Education and awareness campaigns are essential to inform the public, and economic incentives can encourage the adoption of energy-efficient lighting technologies. Artificial light at night poses a significant threat to ecosystems and human health, requiring technological innovation, policy interventions, public awareness, and economic incentives.
