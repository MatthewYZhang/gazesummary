Animal navigation remains a fascinating and puzzling area of study, with animals undertaking incredible journeys across vast distances with astonishing precision. One explanation centers on the use of environmental cues, as animals may rely on landmarks, like mountains and rivers, to orient themselves during migration. For instance, birds follow distinct geographical features, while salmon use their natal streams' scent to return to spawning grounds.

Another theory suggests animals possess an innate compass sense and can detect the Earth's magnetic field using specialized cells containing magnetite. Animals may also use the position of the sun and stars for navigation, and they can maintain a consistent bearing by tracking the sun's movement or recognizing constellations. To achieve greater accuracy and flexibility, animals may combine multiple navigational cues, highlighting their cognitive abilities and the complexity of their strategies. Ultimately, the study of animal navigation informs our understanding of human cognition and inspires new technologies.
