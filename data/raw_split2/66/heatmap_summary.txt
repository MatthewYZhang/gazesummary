For decades, beekeepers have noted the sudden and unexplained disappearance of honeybees, known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), posing a significant threat to global agriculture and ecosystems. This disturbing phenomenon has prompted intense scientific investigation, yet a definitive cause for CCD remains elusive despite numerous factors being implicated.

One prevailing hypothesis concentrates on the impact of neonicotinoid pesticides, widely used systemic insecticides absorbed by plants and found in pollen and nectar. Exposure to these neonicotinoids can impair bee navigation, foraging behavior, and immune function, making bees more susceptible to diseases and environmental stressors. However, critics contend that neonicotinoids alone cannot fully account for CCD. The investigation into CCD has highlighted that selective breeding practices may have inadvertently reduced the genetic diversity of honeybee populations. Bees are now more susceptible to diseases and less adaptable to changing environments, leading researchers to explore breeding bees for resistance to parasites and diseases.

Despite extensive research, CCD remains a complex, multifactorial problem with no easy solution. Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach that includes reducing pesticide use, promoting habitat diversity, managing parasites and pathogens, and enhancing bee genetics.
