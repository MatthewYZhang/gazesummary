Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, was the Mississippian culture's largest urban center. From around 800 to 1400 CE, this society with its earthworks and social structure experienced a dramatic decline. At its peak around 1100 CE, Cahokia covered six square miles and housed 10,000 to 20,000 people, making it one of the largest cities in the world. The city's impressive feature is Monks Mound, a platform larger than the Great Pyramid of Giza. Around 1200 CE, Cahokia began to decline due to warfare, social unrest, and environmental degradation. Several theories explain Cahokia's abandonment, including overpopulation and climate change. It is likely that a combination of factors contributed to Cahokia's demise. Ongoing archaeological research continues to shed light on the mysteries of Cahokia and its place in the history of North America.
