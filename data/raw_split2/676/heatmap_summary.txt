Terrace farming significantly shaped the agricultural practices and societal structures of the Andean region, where steep slopes, limited arable land, and fluctuating rainfall patterns posed obstacles to food production. This system involves constructing level platforms on hillsides and mountainsides, supported by stone walls to prevent erosion and retain soil moisture. The flat surfaces provide areas for planting crops, and the walls create microclimates buffering against temperature extremes. This technique allowed for the cultivation of various crops.

The Inca utilized a highly organized labor system known as *mita* to construct and maintain terrace systems. The terraces allowed them to cultivate crops even in arid regions.

The Spanish conquest in the 16th century led to the abandonment of many terrace systems due to the introduction of European agricultural practices and a decline in indigenous populations. However, there's a renewed interest in terrace farming, with local communities and organizations working to rehabilitate and revitalize abandoned terraces.
