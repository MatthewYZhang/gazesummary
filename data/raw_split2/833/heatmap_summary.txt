Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a behavioral disorder that leads to walking or performing other complex behaviors while still asleep. It typically occurs during the deepest stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. During this stage, the brain's activity is slow and synchronized, and it's difficult to awaken someone. When a sleepwalking episode occurs, the brain seems to be in a mixed state of sleep and wakefulness, allowing for motor activity while cognitive function remains impaired. The exact cause of sleepwalking is not fully understood, but several factors are believed to contribute to the disorder, including genetics, sleep deprivation, stress, fever, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions. The behaviors exhibited during sleepwalking episodes can range from simple activities like sitting up in bed, talking, or walking around the room. Diagnosing sleepwalking typically involves a review of the individual's sleep history and a physical examination, and in some cases, a sleep study or polysomnography, may be recommended.
