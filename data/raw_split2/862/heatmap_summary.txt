Around 1050 A.D., a remarkable urban center flourished in southwestern Illinois, becoming Cahokia, the largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico, reflecting the ingenuity and organizational skills of its inhabitants. However, after growth, Cahokia experienced a decline by the 14th century, with ongoing debate about the reasons for its demise. Cahokia’s monumental earthworks, covering approximately six square miles, with over 120 mounds, including Monks Mound, the largest pre-Columbian earthwork in North America, served various purposes. Cahokia was a center of agricultural production, skilled artisans produced pottery and tools, and craft specialization developed. The city's location facilitated exchange with other Mississippian cultures, trading goods like copper and shell, indicating its regional importance. The causes of Cahokia’s decline in the 13th century are complex, involving environmental degradation from intensive agriculture and deforestation, leading to soil erosion. The legacy of Cahokia, a major center of Mississippian culture, remains undeniable, with ongoing research by archaeologists and historians to unravel its mysteries.
