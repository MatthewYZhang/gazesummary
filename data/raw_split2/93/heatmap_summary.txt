Coral reefs, diverse ecosystems that support marine life and protect coastlines, face increasing threats from coral bleaching. This occurs when corals expel symbiotic algae, zooxanthellae, due to stress, like changes in water temperature, causing the coral to turn white. Bleached corals are weakened, susceptible to disease, and may die if stress is prolonged, leading to mass bleaching events, and the rising ocean temperatures due to climate change is the primary factor.

Other contributing factors include pollution, sedimentation, and overfishing, disrupting the reef ecosystem. This is devastating since when corals die, the reef structure breaks down, causing habitat loss, decline in biodiversity, impacting fisheries, tourism, and coastal communities.

Efforts to protect coral reefs include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving water quality, managing fisheries, restoring damaged reefs, and establishing Marine Protected Areas. Coral restoration projects, like growing corals in nurseries, are also being used, but addressing the root causes of bleaching is important. Taking action to reduce greenhouse gases and protect reefs is essential for the health of the planet.
