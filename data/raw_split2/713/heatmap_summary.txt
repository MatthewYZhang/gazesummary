Sleep, occupying roughly one-third of our lives, is a fundamental biological necessity. Although ubiquitously, the intricate workings of sleep and its precise functions remain partially shrouded in mystery. Sleep was viewed as a passive state of inactivity for centuries, but modern neuroscience has revealed it to be an active and highly organized process crucial for physical and mental well-being. While the exact reasons we sleep are still debated, sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation, tissue repair, hormone regulation, and cognitive restoration. Scientists utilize various techniques to study sleep, including electroencephalography (EEG), which measures brain electrical activity; electromyography (EMG), which records muscle activity; and electrooculography (EOG), which tracks eye movements. Polysomnography combines these measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of sleep architecture and identify potential sleep disorders. Research indicates that sleep is critical for memory consolidation, the process by which new information is transferred from short-term to long-term storage. Sleep deprivation impairs memory consolidation, leading to difficulty learning and remembering new information. Sleep deprivation can disrupt hormone balance, leading to metabolic problems, impaired immune function, and increased risk of chronic diseases.
