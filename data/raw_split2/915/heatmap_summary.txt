The collapse of the Maya civilization, an enduring historical puzzle, saw the abandonment of major centers by the end of the Classic Period. Several theories attempt to explain this decline. One suggests environmental degradation caused by heavy reliance on agriculture, leading to deforestation, soil erosion, reduced soil fertility, and ultimately, widespread famine.

Another prominent theory emphasizes the role of climate change, particularly prolonged and severe droughts impacting agricultural productivity. Increased warfare and conflict among Maya city-states, driven by competition for resources, also contributed by disrupting trade, damaging infrastructure, and diverting resources.

Social and political factors, such as a highly stratified society and the loss of faith in rulers, may have led to social unrest. The Maya collapse likely resulted from a complex interplay of environmental, climatic, military, social, and political factors. The relative importance of these factors varied, resulting in a diverse pattern of decline across the Maya world. This collapse serves as a warning about sustainable resource management, social equity, and adaptability.
