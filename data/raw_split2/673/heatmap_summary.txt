The Mayan civilization, after centuries of growth, experienced a decline beginning around the 9th century CE. The abandonment of major urban centers marks this collapse, and it remains a debated mystery in archaeology. Environmental degradation, such as unsustainable agricultural practices like slash-and-burn and intensive farming, contributed to soil erosion, deforestation, and fertility decline. Climate change, particularly prolonged droughts, exacerbated these issues, impacting agricultural yields and leading to famine. Warfare between city-states drained resources and disrupted trade, and the growing wealth of the elite created social tensions. The decline in the authority of Mayan rulers weakened city-states' ability to cope with environmental challenges. Political instability further contributed to the downfall, and the complex infrastructure of centralized government slowly deteriorated. Large-scale migrations out of Mayan centers led to population declines. Ultimately, the Mayan collapse underscores the fragility of societies and the importance of sustainable management, stability, and social equity.
