Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey, an archaeological site dating back to 9500-8000 B.C.E., has reshaped our understanding of the Neolithic period, predating agriculture and pottery and challenging assumptions about the prerequisites for social complexity and monumental construction. The site features circular structures enclosed by T-shaped limestone pillars, some reaching over 5 meters and weighing up to 10 tons, often adorned with animal carvings like foxes and vultures.

This discovery poses the question of who built Göbekli Tepe and why, considering the builders were hunter-gatherers in a pre-agricultural society. It is suggested that Göbekli Tepe served as a religious or ceremonial center, with the animal carvings representing spiritual beliefs and cosmology. These structures might have hosted rituals and gatherings, drawing people from a wide area, fostering social cohesion, and facilitating resource exchange. The ongoing excavations at Göbekli Tepe provide a new understanding of the origins of civilization and our species' formative shifts regarding social organization.
