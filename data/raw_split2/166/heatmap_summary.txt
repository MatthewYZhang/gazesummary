The Internet, a network of interconnected computer networks, has dramatically reshaped human communication, commerce, and access to information, marking a pivotal moment in modern history. Communication in the pre-Internet era was limited and expensive, with slow postal services and costly long-distance telephone calls, where information was largely confined to libraries and printed media. The emergence of the Internet altered this landscape, making communication faster, cheaper, and more accessible.

The Internet's roots trace back to the late 1960s and the development of ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense project. The primary goal of ARPANET was to create a decentralized communication network able to withstand disruptions caused by potential military attacks. This network utilized packet switching, a revolutionary technology that broke down data into small packets for independent transmission and reassembly, and the ARPANET evolved into the Internet through the development of the TCP/IP protocol suite. The rise of the Internet also had a profound impact on communication, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have transformed the way people connect and share information.
