To understand the rise and fall of Cahokia, one must consider its unique environment, a mosaic of diverse ecosystems that played a critical role in its development. The area was characterized by fertile floodplains ideal for agriculture, with corn, beans, and squash thriving, while the Mississippi River and surrounding forests provided abundant resources. However, this abundance came with challenges, including devastating floods, droughts, and deforestation, requiring sophisticated management strategies.

Archaeological evidence suggests the Cahokians adapted by constructing earthen mounds for protection and developing agricultural techniques like terracing and irrigation. Despite these efforts, the civilization declined in the 13th and 14th centuries, possibly due to environmental factors such as prolonged droughts, overpopulation, and deforestation leading to unsustainable agriculture. One theory suggests a combination of environmental stress and social tensions contributed to the collapse. Regardless of the cause, Cahokia serves as a cautionary tale about the relationship between societies and the environment, highlighting the importance of sustainable resource management and recognizing vulnerability to environmental change.
