Cahokia, located near modern-day Collinsville, Illinois, emerged as the largest urban center north of Mexico and exerted considerable influence over the surrounding region. The success of Cahokia was largely due to its agricultural productivity, as the fertile floodplains surrounding the city were ideal for cultivating maize, beans, and squash, otherwise known as the "Three Sisters" of indigenous agriculture. This intensive agricultural system allowed Cahokia to support a large and concentrated population. The social and political organization of Cahokia, which was ruled by an elite class, was also critical to its success. These ruling elites controlled resources, organized labor, and oversaw religious ceremonies. These leaders resided on Monumental earthen mounds that also served as platforms for temples and sites for public gatherings. By the 14th century, the city's power had waned because it faced several challenges, including environmental degradation, climate change, and internal conflicts. The intensive cultivation of maize depleted the soil, and the city experienced periods of violence and social disruption, all of which contributed to the city's disintegration.
