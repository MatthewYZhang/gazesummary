The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica for over a thousand years, leaving a significant mark on the history of the Americas. From its Preclassic period origins through its peak in the Classic period and eventual decline in the Postclassic period, the reasons for the civilization's decline during the Late Classic period remain debated among historians. The Classic Maya civilization had a complex social hierarchy and developed a sophisticated writing system, a calendar system, and monumental architecture. City-states like Tikal and Palenque competed for power, fostering a dynamic cultural landscape. However, around the 9th century AD, a widespread collapse occurred in the Maya lowlands, with abandoned cities and a declining population. Environmental factors like deforestation, soil erosion, and droughts may have played a role. Internal factors such as political instability and warfare also possibly contributed. The Maya people persevered, adapting to new circumstances and maintaining their cultural traditions in the highlands of Guatemala. Today, millions of Maya people still live in Mesoamerica, preserving their languages, customs, and traditions.
