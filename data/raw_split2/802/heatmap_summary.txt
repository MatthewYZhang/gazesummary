The Carolina Bays are elliptical depressions found across the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. Their origin has been a source of scientific debate. One of the earliest theories suggests that the Carolina Bays were created by a meteor shower, with a swarm of extraterrestrial objects striking the sandy coastal plain. This impact hypothesis suggests that the angle of entry of the meteorites into the Earth's atmosphere is the cause of the orientation of the bays and proponents have pointed to the presence of melted sand and elevated levels of iridium as evidence. However, no meteoritic material has been recovered. While the wind and water action theory suggests that prevailing winds across shallow lakes carved the elliptical depressions, another variation suggests that groundwater dissolved limestone bedrock, creating sinkholes that collapsed. The glacial ice impact hypothesis suggests that secondary impacts from ejected ice debris formed the bays. Despite these theories, the origin of the Carolina Bays remains a mystery.
