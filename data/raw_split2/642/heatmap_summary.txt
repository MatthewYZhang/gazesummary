The Maya civilization, flourishing in Mesoamerica from approximately 250 to 900 AD, represents one of the most advanced societies of the ancient world. Their achievements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture rivaled those of contemporary cultures in Europe and Asia. This sophisticated civilization ultimately declined, leaving behind a legacy of mystery.

The Maya civilization was composed of independent city-states, each ruled by a king. Their economy was primarily based on agriculture, with maize, beans, and squash forming the staple crops. The Maya developed sophisticated agricultural techniques to maximize crop yields.

The decline in the 9th century AD was likely due to overpopulation, deforestation, and soil erosion, as well as warfare and drought. However, the Maya civilization did not disappear entirely, and some city-states continued to thrive. The Maya also maintained their cultural identity and traditions, even under Spanish colonial rule. The legacy of the Maya civilization is profound, and ongoing research continues to deepen our understanding of this fascinating civilization.
