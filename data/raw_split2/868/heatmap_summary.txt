Memory is a complex system of distinct components: sensory, short-term, and long-term. The last one is capable of retaining information over extended periods, and it can be subdivided into explicit and implicit memory. Explicit memory involves conscious recall of facts or events, such as semantic or episodic memory. Implicit memory, on the other hand, operates unconsciously. Moreover, memories can be fallible and affected by several factors. Stress, leading questions, or comments can alter memories, a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect. Different brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex, play distinct roles in memory. Finally, despite progress, many mysteries remain about memory encoding, storage, and how to distinguish between genuine and false ones. Answering these questions will require research and interdisciplinary collaborations.
