Coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots that owe their existence to symbiotic relationships, especially between coral polyps and zooxanthellae. This symbiotic partnership is critical for understanding reef health and resilience. The foundation of the coral reef ecosystem rests on the mutually beneficial relationship between coral polyps and zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae reside within coral polyps, providing them with nutrients through photosynthesis. Zooxanthellae use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars for the polyps' energy, growth, and skeleton formation. In return, the polyps provide the zooxanthellae with a protected environment and a supply of carbon dioxide. Symbiotic relationships make coral reefs vulnerable to environmental stressors, like coral bleaching caused by elevated water temperatures, leading to the expulsion of zooxanthellae. Similarly, pollution, sedimentation, and ocean acidification can disrupt the balance of symbiotic relationships. Recognizing the role of symbiosis is crucial for effective conservation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change, pollution, and other threats.
