The camera has undergone a significant transformation from its early beginnings to today's digital technologies, impacting fields like art, science, journalism, and personal documentation. The camera obscura, a darkened room projecting inverted images, served as an early precursor, utilized by Renaissance artists as a drawing aid, though it lacked image capture and preservation.

The birth of photography arrived in the early 19th century. Nicéphore Niépce created the first permanent photograph using a camera obscura and a pewter plate, though the heliography process lacked practicality. Louis Daguerre improved the process with the daguerreotype, producing detailed images and reducing exposure times, but it was expensive and non-reproducible. In the 1850s, the collodion process emerged, offering shorter exposure times and multiple prints, gaining popularity and leading to commercial photography studios. The Kodak camera, introduced by George Eastman in 1888, revolutionized photography with its ease of use, making it accessible to a wider audience. Finally, the rise of digital photography, cameras are now ubiquitous and integrated into various devices.
