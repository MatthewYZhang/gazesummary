Urban farming, or urban agriculture, is the cultivation, processing, and distribution of food in urban areas, addressing food security, community health, and environmental sustainability. It is driven by global challenges and technological advancements. Factors contributing to its rise include escalating concerns about food security due to population growth and climate change, and a desire to shorten supply chains, reduce reliance on distant food sources, and provide fresh produce, particularly to food deserts. It also addresses the environmental impact of conventional agriculture by reducing carbon footprint and utilizing sustainable practices like composting, rainwater harvesting, and reduced pesticide use. Urban farming also offers social and economic benefits such as job creation, community engagement, and educational programs. Types of urban farming include community gardens, rooftop farms, vertical farms, and aquaponics systems. Despite challenges, urban farming has the potential to transform urban landscapes and contribute to a more sustainable food system.
