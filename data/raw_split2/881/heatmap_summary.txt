The history of science is not a smooth, continuous accumulation of knowledge; instead, it is punctuated by revolutionary changes where fundamental assumptions are challenged and replaced. Thomas Kuhn argued that scientific progress occurs through paradigm shifts. A paradigm is a set of shared beliefs, values, and techniques held by a scientific community. During normal science, scientists solve puzzles within the existing paradigm, but anomalies arise that cannot be explained by the prevailing paradigm. A new paradigm emerges, resolving these anomalies. Initially, anomalies may be dismissed, but growing anomalies undermine confidence in the paradigm. The transition to a new paradigm involves social and psychological factors. An example of a scientific revolution is the shift from Newtonian physics to Einsteinian relativity. Newtonian physics failed to explain certain phenomena, while Einstein's theory of relativity offered a different understanding. Finally, Kuhn's theory has faced criticism for its concept of incommensurability, with critics arguing it's too strong to compare different paradigms.
