Dams, built across rivers for water control and hydroelectric power, have greatly changed river ecosystems globally, leading to both advantages like flood control and environmental drawbacks. Dams disrupt natural river flow, altering the timing and magnitude of water releases, with significant consequences for river hydrology. Seasonal floods are often suppressed by dams, impacting floodplain ecosystems and nutrient cycling. Altered sediment transport leads to downstream erosion and upstream accumulation, with implications for habitat and water quality. These hydrological changes can result in increased water temperatures, decreased oxygen levels, and altered salinity gradients, affecting aquatic organisms. Addressing these impacts involves considering dam removal to restore rivers, modifying dam operations for natural flow patterns, and employing fish passage technologies. Additionally, sustainable water management and holistic river management approaches are essential to minimize environmental effects and ensure the continued services these ecosystems provide.
