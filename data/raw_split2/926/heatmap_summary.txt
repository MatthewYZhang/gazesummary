Before printing, scribes, often monks or scholars, meticulously copied texts by hand, a process prone to errors and making books scarce and expensive, limiting access to the wealthy and religious institutions. The earliest printing was woodblock printing in China around the 3rd century CE, where entire pages were carved onto wooden blocks and pressed onto paper. In the 8th century, Buddhist scriptures were printed in Korea. While woodblock printing was significant, it was cumbersome due to each page needing its own carved block.

The invention of movable type in 11th-century China by Bi Sheng used baked clay characters, but clay was fragile and the Chinese language's vast number of characters made it demanding to maintain a complete set of type. Johannes Gutenberg refined movable type in Europe during the mid-15th century. Gutenberg used metal letters and developed a printing press, resulting in clearer impressions. His achievement was the Gutenberg Bible around 1455. However, the rise of printing also led to censorship and regulation as governments tried to control information. Despite censorship attempts, printing continued to flourish, emphasizing the free flow of information in societies.
