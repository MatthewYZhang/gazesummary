The novel, now widely popular, rose to prominence mainly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, shaped by social, economic, and technological shifts. Before this, prose fiction existed as romances or moralistic tales for aristocrats, focusing on idealized heroes and fantastical adventures. However, the expanding commercial activity and literacy created a burgeoning middle class that craved stories reflecting their experiences, exploring social mobility and relationships. Printing technology enabled the novel's growth, with more affordable books and the rise of periodicals increasing readership. The novel also benefited from Enlightenment philosophy, with an emphasis on reason and the importance of sensory experience. Novels like Charles Dickens' *Oliver Twist* shed light on the plight of the poor and the harsh realities of industrialization. The emergence of a literate middle class, advancements in printing technology, the influence of Enlightenment philosophy, and the contributions of pioneering novelists all contributed to the novel's ascendancy.
