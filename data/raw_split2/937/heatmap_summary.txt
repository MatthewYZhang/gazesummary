Animal migration, an enthralling yet enigmatic phenomenon, involves the large-scale movement of species, influenced by resource availability, breeding, and climatic conditions. Despite extensive research, how animals navigate with such precision, especially birds migrating thousands of miles to the same nesting sites, remains a mystery. Scientists think birds rely on the Earth's magnetic field, the sun and stars, and landmarks. Some birds have specialized cells to sense magnetic fields, while others learn routes from older generations.

The triggers for initiating migration are also unclear, though changes in day length, temperature, and food may be important. Hormonal changes, like increased fat storage in birds, may also play a role. Recent technological advances, such as satellite tracking and genetic analysis, are providing insights into migration. Satellite tracking allows researchers to follow animals, while genetic analysis reveals evolutionary history and genes involved in navigation. The study of migration is important for conservation. Loss of habitat along migratory routes can harm populations, and understanding migration is essential for protecting habitats and ensuring survival. Climate change also threatens migration, affecting routes, breeding, and food availability.
