The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica, known for its advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and art. This civilization was organized as a collection of independent city-states, interconnected through trade, alliances, and warfare, with a complex hierarchical system led by a king. Despite their achievements, environmental degradation, including deforestation, soil erosion, and water shortages, coupled with political instability and constant warfare among the city-states, contributed to the civilization's decline. The decline was a gradual process over centuries, leading to the abandonment of major cities.

The Great Migration involved millions of African Americans moving from the rural South to the urban North, Midwest, and West. This was driven by economic opportunities, as the promise of better lives in the North arose in the wake of Jim Crow laws and the threat of violence in the South. The Great Migration was a multifaceted event, driven by a combination of economic, social, and political factors that transformed American society.
