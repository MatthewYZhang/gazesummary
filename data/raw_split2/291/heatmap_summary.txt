Animal migration is a captivating phenomenon driven by resource availability, ensuring survival and reproductive success. Many animals breed in regions abundant in food during summer but migrate to warmer climates or areas with reliable food sources during winter. Wildebeest in the Serengeti follow seasonal rains for fresh grazing lands, while birds fly south to escape freezing temperatures and find food.

Navigation during migration involves various sensory cues, with some animals relying on celestial navigation using the sun, moon, and stars. Birds possess a “magnetic compass” calibrated by visual landmarks, while salmon use their sense of smell to find their natal rivers. The distances covered can be astonishing, like the Arctic tern's 70,000-kilometer journey.

Monarch butterflies undertake a multi-generational migration, with successive generations continuing southward. Migration faces challenges like physical demands, predation risk, and habitat loss. Conservation efforts are crucial for protecting migratory species. Understanding migration intricacies has implications for conservation biology. Despite research, many aspects of animal migration remain a mystery, driving scientific inquiry into this fascinating process.
