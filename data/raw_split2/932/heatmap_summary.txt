Coral reefs, known for their biological diversity, are built by colonial animals called corals, supporting a vast array of marine life. The symbiotic relationship between corals and zooxanthellae, microscopic algae, is essential for reef building. Zooxanthellae reside within coral tissues, providing the coral with energy through photosynthesis. In return, the coral provides the algae with a protected environment and nutrients. This partnership enables corals to secrete calcium carbonate skeletons to form three-dimensional structures of reefs. Coral reefs face climate change and human activities, causing coral bleaching when corals expel zooxanthellae. Ocean acidification reduces calcium carbonate, hindering coral growth. Human activities such as overfishing and destructive fishing practices also contribute to the decline. Scientists and conservationists are developing strategies to protect coral reefs. Reducing our carbon footprint and implementing effective marine management can ensure the survival of coral reefs for future generations.
