The printing press, which applies pressure to an inked surface on a print medium, is a transformative invention that revolutionized information dissemination and caused societal changes. It was invented in the mid-15th century Europe, which used movable type. Before this, books were copied by hand by monks, which was expensive, slow, and prone to errors. Gutenberg, a German goldsmith, developed a printing press that used movable type which reduced the time and cost of making books. This led to a cascade of effects, which led to the cost of books decreasing and becoming accessible to more people, which fueled literacy and vernacular languages. The printing press played a crucial role in the Renaissance, Reformation, and in science, which allowed scientists to share their findings. Even with the advent of digital technologies, the legacy of the printing press remains profound and challenged existing power structures.
