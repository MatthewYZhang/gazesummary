Between 3,500 and 500 years ago, Polynesian seafarers colonized a vast triangle stretching from Hawai'i in the north, to Aotearoa (New Zealand) in the south, and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the east. Navigational skills were passed down through generations, revealing a sophisticated understanding of the natural world. Archaeological evidence, linguistic analysis, and oral traditions highlight the skilled navigators who combined observation, memory, and experimentation. Traditional Polynesian canoes, such as *wa'a kaulua*, were designed for long-distance voyages.

Polynesians utilized wayfinding techniques, relying on stars, swells, winds, and seabirds instead of charts or compasses. The Polynesians were adept at reading the ocean by discerning subtle patterns in waves and swells to determine direction and distance to land. The transmission of navigational knowledge was carefully guarded through families or specialized schools. Apprentice navigators underwent training, memorizing star charts, and learning to interpret ocean swells, ensuring the continuity of Polynesian voyaging traditions. The successful colonization of remote islands, such as Hawai'i and Rapa Nui, demonstrates the extraordinary navigational abilities of the Polynesian people.
