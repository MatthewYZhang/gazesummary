Tikal, located in the Pet√©n rainforest of northern Guatemala, was a significant city of the Maya civilization, flourishing from the 3rd to the 9th century AD. The origins of Tikal are somewhat obscure, but archaeological evidence indicates habitation as early as the Middle Preclassic period. It began to develop into an urban center during the Late Preclassic period marked by monumental construction and the emergence of a hierarchical social structure. 

Tikal faced challenges from its rivals, especially Calakmul, during the Late Classic period. Calakmul launched an attack in AD 562, resulting in Tikal's temporary subjugation and the disruption of its dynastic succession. By the late 9th century, Tikal experienced a decline and abandonment, possibly due to factors such as overpopulation and environmental degradation. Despite its abandonment, Tikal continues to hold significance and has become a tourist destination. Ongoing archaeological research sheds light on the city's past, and the legacy of Tikal endures as a testament to the ancient Maya.
