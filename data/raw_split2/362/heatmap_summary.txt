The rise and fall of ancient civilizations have shaped history, with complex societies experiencing both periods of prosperity and collapse. While environmental degradation was initially considered the primary cause, modern scholarship recognizes the multi-faceted nature of civilizational decline, including economic instability, social unrest, and external pressures. Two types of societal collapse are distinguished: "classic" collapse, involving rapid disintegration of centralized authority, and "transformation," involving a gradual shift in power structures and cultural norms. The Roman Empire experienced a combination of factors, including internal strife, economic woes, barbarian incursions, and potentially climate change.

In the "post-collapse" phase of a society, the landscape undergoes dramatic changes, with decaying infrastructure, abandoned agricultural land, and declining populations. However, the seeds of future civilizations may be sown during this period, as the cultural knowledge, traditions, and technologies of the collapsed civilization can be preserved and adapted by successor cultures. Once a civilization passes into its "post-glory" phase, it can separate effectively into two different historical interpretations: a romanticized past and a cautionary tale.
