Honeybees have played a vital role in global agriculture and ecosystems for millennia, with their foraging and pollination being essential for the production of numerous crops, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. However, over the past few decades, honeybee populations have experienced a dramatic and alarming decline, raising concerns about agriculture and biodiversity. This decline is known as Colony Collapse Disorder, where worker bees suddenly disappear from a hive. The causes of CCD are under research, but factors such as habitat loss, pesticide exposure, parasites, diseases, and climate change are believed to contribute to the decline.

Habitat loss is a major driver, where natural landscapes are converted into agricultural fields, urban areas, and industrial zones. This leads to honeybees losing access to diverse floral resources. Also, the decline in wildflower meadows and hedgerows reduces the availability of pollen and nectar, which is essential for bee health. The value of honeybee pollination is in the billions annually and is important to food security.
