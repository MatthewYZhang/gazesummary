Civilizations rise and fall, leaving ruins and legacies that intrigue and inform us. Patterns emerge when comparing their trajectories, with factors like environmental change, internal conflict, economic instability, and external pressures contributing to the weakening and collapse of societies. The Roman Empire, which dominated the Mediterranean, expanded its resources but was eroded from within by overextension, political corruption, and economic inequality, leading to its fragmentation in the 5th century CE. Unlike Rome, the Mayans were not conquered by external forces; scholars believe that environmental factors, particularly prolonged droughts, played a significant role in their downfall. The Anasazi civilization grew and flourished until the Great Drought occurred, and they were no longer able to produce enough agriculture to support their population. These examples highlight that environmental degradation, social inequality, political instability, and external pressures can all undermine a civilization's foundations, leading to its eventual collapse.
