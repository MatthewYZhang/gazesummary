The Sahara Desert, a vast and diverse landscape stretching across North Africa, is the largest hot desert in the world. It is characterized by sand dunes, gravel plains, rocky plateaus, and mountains, resulting from a complex geological history and climatic forces over millions of years.

The Sahara's geological foundation is largely Precambrian rock, some of the oldest on Earth. These ancient rocks have been uplifted, folded, and faulted by tectonic activity. During the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, much of the Sahara was submerged, resulting in layers of sedimentary rock, evident in the plateaus and escarpments. The shifting and migrating dunes are shaped by the prevailing winds, leading to a dynamic landscape.

Despite its harsh environment, the Sahara has also been shaped by human activity. Flash floods can carve deep canyons. Plants and animals have adapted to the arid conditions.
