Tourism significantly impacts small island ecosystems, both positively and negatively. While tourism can drive economic development and improve living standards, it also strains the fragile ecosystems of these islands. This is primarily due to the increased demand for resources like water, energy, and food as tourist populations grow. The reliance on fossil fuels exacerbates climate change, leading to rising sea levels and coral bleaching. Additionally, tourism can create waste management challenges, including plastic pollution that harms marine life. However, tourism can also generate revenue for environmental protection and incentivize local communities to protect natural resources through ecotourism ventures. To mitigate the negative impacts, sustainable tourism planning, investment in renewable energy, and the promotion of ecotourism are crucial. Ultimately, balancing environmental protection, social equity, and economic development is necessary for the long-term sustainability of tourism in these ecosystems.
