The Mayan civilization flourished in Mesoamerica for over 2,000 years, with advancements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. The civilization's complexity significantly rose during the Classic Period, when the Maya developed a hieroglyphic writing system, a complex calendar system, and built monumental cities. Mayan society was highly stratified, with a ruling elite of kings and priests. Agriculture was central, with maize as the staple crop. Religion played a crucial role in Mayan life. Rituals and ceremonies, often involving human sacrifice, were performed to appease the gods and ensure the continuation of the cosmic order. While southern lowlands declined, Mayan civilization persisted in the northern Yucat√°n Peninsula, where cities like Chichen Itza and Uxmal flourished. The Spanish conquest brought disease, warfare, and cultural disruption. Despite the conquest, the Mayan people and their culture have endured, with millions of descendants preserving their heritage.
