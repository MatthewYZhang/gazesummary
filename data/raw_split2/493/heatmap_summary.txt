Birds are admired for their ability to undertake migrations. These migrations involve seasonal movement between breeding and non-breeding areas and understanding their complexities requires exploring motivations and strategies. The primary driver of bird migration is resource availability, as birds exploit seasonal peaks in food abundance. In temperate and arctic regions, insects provide nourishment for raising young. As winter approaches and food becomes scarce, birds migrate to warmer climates where sustenance remains readily available. Navigating across continents requires skills, as birds employ cues to maintain their course like the Earth's magnetic field and celestial cues such as the sun and stars. Landmark recognition also plays a role.

Migrating birds contribute to the health and diversity of ecosystems by dispersing seeds and pollinating. They also regulate insect populations and the arrival of migratory birds can signal the start of a new season. Migratory birds face challenges like habitat loss, climate change, and collisions. Some birds, like the Arctic Tern, undertake journeys spanning thousands of miles. Altitudinal migration, where birds move between elevations, is common in mountainous regions. Stopover sites are critical for their survival and protecting these habitats is essential. Scientists use radio transmitters to monitor bird movements and isotope analysis to provide information about diet. The study of bird migration helps us better appreciate the interconnectedness of ecosystems.
