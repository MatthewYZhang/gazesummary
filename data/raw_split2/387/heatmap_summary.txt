The fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River have sustained diverse populations for centuries, including the remarkable Mississippian culture that thrived from 800 to 1600 CE. At the heart of this civilization was Cahokia, near Collinsville, Illinois, an urban center rivaling contemporary European cities at its peak.

Cahokia's rapid growth during the 11th and 12th centuries CE stemmed from intensive maize agriculture from Mesoamerica, abundant food supply, the Mississippi River as a transportation artery, and its strategic location at the confluence of major rivers which also gave it access to a wide range of resources.

Cahokia declined by the 14th century due to factors like environmental degradation including deforestation and overhunting, population pressure, climate change, and the rise of other regional centers. By the time the European explorers arrived in the Mississippi Valley, Cahokia was largely abandoned. The once-thriving metropolis was reduced to a collection of overgrown mounds, which is now a State Historic Site. Mesoamerica is a region extending from central Mexico, and Stratified means arranged in hierarchical social structure.
