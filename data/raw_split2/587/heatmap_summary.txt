Cahokia was a thriving pre-Columbian civilization in southwestern Illinois, flourishing from around 1050 to 1350 CE. Cahokia was the heart of Mississippian culture, a sophisticated society with a complex social structure, impressive engineering skills, and a unique worldview. One of the most visible features of Cahokia is its massive earthen mounds, serving as platforms for temples, residences of elites, and other important structures. Monks Mound, the largest of these, covers 14 acres and rises to a height of 100 feet. Cahokia was a bustling urban hub with a population of at least 10,000. Cahokians were skilled farmers, cultivating maize, beans, squash, and other crops. Their civilization was laid out with mounds arranged around a central plaza, and residential areas radiating outwards. Researchers believe that Cahokian priests and leaders used their knowledge of the movements of the sun, moon, and stars to regulate agricultural cycles, predict important events, and legitimize their authority. The reasons for its decline are debated. Today, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site preserves the remains of this civilization, offering visitors a glimpse into the lives and beliefs of its people. Ongoing archaeological research continues to shed new light on the mysteries of Cahokia.
