Mycorrhizae are a symbiotic association between fungi and plant roots, playing a crucial role in terrestrial ecosystems, especially forests. The term "mycorrhiza" means "fungus root," representing the intricate network between fungal hyphae and roots.

The two primary types are ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form a sheath around the root and extend hyphae into the soil and between root cortex cells, common in temperate and boreal forests. Endomycorrhizae penetrate the root cells, forming arbuscules, and are common among various plant species, including agricultural crops. The benefits are reciprocal: fungi gain sugars via plant photosynthesis, while plants enhance water and essential nutrient absorption from the soil, with hyphae accessing nutrients like phosphorus, nitrogen, and micronutrients.

Mycorrhizae contribute to plant resistance to stress and disease by physically protecting roots and stimulating defense mechanisms. Intensive agriculture and deforestation can disrupt mycorrhizal networks. Conservation practices are critical for enhancing forest productivity. Ongoing research uses new technologies to identify the diversity of mycorrhizal fungi.
