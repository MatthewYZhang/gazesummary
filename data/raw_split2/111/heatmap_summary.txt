Artificial light at night (ALAN) disrupts the natural rhythm of day and night and is recognized as an environmental stressor. Light pollution encompasses unwanted or excessive artificial light, like skyglow, light trespass, glare, and clutter. While it offers benefits, its unchecked proliferation carries ecological costs.

ALAN disrupts animal behavior, especially for nocturnal animals that rely on darkness for foraging, mating, and predator avoidance. Artificial light disorients creatures, making them vulnerable to predation and affecting their ability to find food or mates. Sea turtle hatchlings are drawn inland by artificial lights, leading to dehydration, exhaustion, and death, and migratory birds can become disoriented by urban lights. It can also affect animal physiology, suppressing melatonin production and potentially leading to sleep disorders, weakened immune systems, and reproductive problems.

The impact extends to plant life as well, interfering with photoperiodism and altering flowering times. Addressing light pollution requires policy changes, technological innovations, and public awareness. Simple measures like shielding light fixtures, using low-intensity lighting, and turning off unnecessary lights can significantly reduce light pollution, and switching to LED lighting with warmer color temperatures can also minimize its ecological impact. Recognizing the ecological costs of ALAN and adopting responsible lighting practices is crucial for protecting biodiversity.
