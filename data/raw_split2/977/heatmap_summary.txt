Coral reefs are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems on Earth, built by coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate. Their evolution is linked to environmental conditions like sea level and temperature. The geological record shows coral reefs have existed for millions of years, with the first reefs in the Triassic period and modern corals emerging in the Mesozoic era. Reefs flourish in shallow, tropical waters due to the symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and zooxanthellae. The distribution of coral reefs is not uniform, with the largest reefs found in the Indo-Pacific region. Coral reefs provide habitat for 25 percent of all marine species, offering shelter and feeding grounds, and play roles in coastal protection, tourism, and fishing. However, they face threats from human activities and climate change, including coral bleaching and ocean acidification. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to address coral bleaching and ocean acidification. Marine protected areas can provide refuges for reef species and allow damaged reefs to recover.
