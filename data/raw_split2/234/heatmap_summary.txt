Cahokia, a remarkable city, flourished around 1050 CE in the Mississippi River floodplain near St. Louis, becoming the largest and most influential Mississippian settlement. At its peak, its population was estimated to be between 10,000 and 20,000 people. The city's landscape was dominated by over 120 man-made mounds, including Monks Mound, which was the largest prehistoric earthwork in North America. These mounds served as platforms for residences, temples, and ceremonial spaces, indicating a highly organized society.

Cahokia's economy relied on maize agriculture, supported by a large non-agricultural population of craftspeople, religious leaders, and political administrators. The society was highly stratified, with the elite residing on the largest mounds and controlling political and religious life.

Cahokia's prosperity was relatively short-lived, declining around 1250 CE. The reasons for this decline are complex, with hypotheses including environmental factors, social unrest, and warfare. The decline marked the end of an era, although the Mississippian culture persisted. Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site stands as a testament to the Mississippian people's ingenuity.
