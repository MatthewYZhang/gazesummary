The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica for over two millennia, exhibiting sophisticated achievements in mathematics, astronomy, and art. Their intricate religious beliefs and complex social structure contributed to an enduring legacy. During the Classic period, the Maya culture reached its zenith, marked by the emergence of city-states like Tikal, Palenque, and Cop√°n. These cities featured monumental architecture, including towering pyramids and elaborate palaces, built by a highly stratified society, with a ruling elite that controlled vast territories. The Maya also boasted monumental architecture. The Maya were skilled agriculturalists, who used advanced techniques like terracing and irrigation to cultivate maize, beans, and squash. One of the most impressive achievements of the Maya was their writing system, which was a complex combination of hieroglyphs that represented words, syllables, and sounds. The Maya mathematicians developed a positional numeral system that included a concept of zero. The Maya civilization experienced a dramatic decline, due to environmental degradation, overpopulation, climate change, internal conflicts, and political instability. However, Maya culture continued in other regions. Despite the challenges brought by Spanish conquest, Maya culture survived, with millions of Maya people preserving their languages and traditions. The legacy of the Maya serves as a reminder of the rise and fall of complex societies.
