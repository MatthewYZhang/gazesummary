Before the 18th century, English gardens, especially those of the wealthy, largely followed formal styles common in Europe. These gardens, inspired by Italian Renaissance designs and Versailles, featured strict geometric layouts, symmetrical arrangements, and manicured plants, prioritizing order and control. Nature was tamed and sculpted, with topiary, parterres, and statues as common elements, extending the house's dominance over the landscape.

However, a shift in aesthetic values emerged in the early 18th century, influenced by philosophical and literary trends. Writers like Joseph Addison and Alexander Pope advocated for a more natural and picturesque garden design, criticizing the formal style's artificiality and rigidity. This movement coincided with growing interest in landscape painting, particularly the works of Claude Lorrain and Nicolas Poussin, whose pastoral scenes became models for garden designers. Some critics argued that it was just as artificial as the formal style it replaced, simply using different techniques to manipulate nature. They criticized the vast expense of creating these landscapes, arguing that they were a symbol of aristocratic wealth and power. Despite these criticisms, the English landscape garden remains a significant achievement in the history of garden design, representing a unique blend of art, nature, and philosophy.
