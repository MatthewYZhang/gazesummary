Mycorrhizae, a symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi, plays a vital role in forest ecosystems, with the term "mycorrhiza" meaning "fungus root." Ectomycorrhizae, common in temperate forests, form a mantle around plant roots, enhancing nutrient and water absorption. They penetrate root cortex cells to create nutrient exchange networks, and endomycorrhizae, prevalent in grasslands and tropical forests, directly penetrate root cortex cells to form arbuscules, which are the primary sites of nutrient exchange.

Mycorrhizae's benefits are numerous, helping plants access essential nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, especially in nutrient-poor soils, while fungi receive carbohydrates from plants through photosynthesis.

They also contribute to soil health, binding soil particles to improve structure and reduce erosion. Disturbances like deforestation and pollution can disrupt mycorrhizal networks, impacting forest health. Protecting and promoting mycorrhizal fungi is crucial for healthy forests, supported by sustainable forestry practices and inoculation in degraded areas.
