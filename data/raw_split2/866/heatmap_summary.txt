The world's oceans face an unprecedented threat: the accumulation of microplastics, which are tiny plastic particles less than five millimeters in diameter and are ubiquitous in marine environments. Microplastics pose a significant risk to marine life and potentially to human health, raising concerns among scientists and environmentalists.

Microplastics originate from various sources, including cosmetics, cleaning agents, and industrial abrasives. Secondary microplastics result from the breakdown of larger plastic debris. Microplastics can persist for decades, accumulating in sediments, shorelines, and the water column.

Filter feeders ingest microplastics unintentionally, mistaking them for food particles. Larger marine animals can also ingest microplastics, potentially causing physical harm, such as blockages and abrasions. Plastics can adsorb persistent organic pollutants from the surrounding environment. Source reduction is crucial, involving measures such as reducing plastic production, promoting the use of biodegradable alternatives, and improving waste management practices. Raising public awareness is critical.
