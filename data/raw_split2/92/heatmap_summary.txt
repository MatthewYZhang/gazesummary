Coastal ecosystems, encompassing salt marshes, mangrove forests, coral reefs, and estuaries, provide habitat for a vast array of species and support fisheries. These ecosystems are increasingly threatened by the accelerating impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels, a direct consequence of global warming, pose a significant risk, with coastlines gradually inundated as glaciers melt and ocean water expands. Salt marshes and mangrove forests are particularly vulnerable, leading to habitat loss and biodiversity decline, while saltwater intrusion alters salinity levels in estuaries. Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to increased nutrient and sediment loads, causing algal blooms and oxygen depletion, or prolonged droughts can reduce freshwater input, increasing salinity levels. Extreme weather events can cause damage through storm surges, flooding, and erosion. Addressing these impacts requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions, restoring coastal habitats, and implementing adaptation strategies to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Restoring and protecting coastal habitats can enhance their resilience to climate change. Proactive measures can mitigate impacts and enhance the resilience of these vital environments.
