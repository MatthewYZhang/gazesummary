Written language is a recent development compared to spoken language. The emergence of writing systems was driven by factors ranging from practical needs to symbolic expression. The earliest writing systems, like cuneiform and hieroglyphics, emerged independently around the fourth millennium BCE. These systems were logographic, where symbols represented whole words or concepts. Cuneiform involved pressing wedge-shaped marks into clay tablets, while hieroglyphics consisted of elaborate pictorial symbols. The development of these systems was closely tied to societal needs, including record-keeping and administration. The most significant breakthrough was the invention of the alphabet, where each symbol represents a phoneme. The earliest known alphabet was developed by the Phoenicians and consisted of 22 consonants. The spread of the alphabet facilitated literacy and communication, requiring fewer symbols to learn. The adoption of alphabetic writing systems also had profound cultural and intellectual consequences, making texts more accessible. The development of written language has transformed civilization by enabling the preservation and transmission of knowledge.
