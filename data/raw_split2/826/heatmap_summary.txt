Colony collapse disorder (CCD) involves the sudden disappearance of worker bees from a hive, leaving behind the queen. The phenomenon poses a threat to global agriculture because bees are crucial pollinators. One hypothesis is that neonicotinoid pesticides, which are absorbed by the plant and present in pollen and nectar, can impair bees' foraging abilities and immune systems. Varroa mites also contribute to CCD, and they can develop resistance to treatments. Reducing pesticides, controlling Varroa mites, improving bee nutrition, managing pathogens, and mitigating climate change are steps to protecting bee populations. The interactions between these factors need to be understood, and strategies for preventing CCD need to be developed. The mystery of the vanishing bees is complex and multifaceted and requires a comprehensive approach to address.
