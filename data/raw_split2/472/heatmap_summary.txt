Urban planning, the systematic shaping of cities, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries due to challenges from industrialization and urbanization. This shift marked a move to proactive city-building.

Key factors included industrial revolution that led to overcrowding and poor housing, creating disease and social unrest. Also, new technologies led to opportunities to reshape urban landscapes to improve city dweller quality of life. Increased awareness of social and environmental problems arose from social movements and scientific research, fostering the need for efficient urban areas.

Early urban planners drew inspiration from architecture, landscape gardening, and social reform, leading to movements. The City Beautiful movement called for grand urban designs to inspire pride, emphasizing visual appeal. Simultaneously, the Garden City movement promoted self-contained communities combining urban and rural benefits.

The 20th century saw the establishment of formal urban planning and zoning, dividing cities into zones for specific land use. Additionally, there were comprehensive plans with goals for urban growth.

Despite the limitations of early urban planning, it represented a significant step towards creating more livable cities, mitigating the effects of industrialization and urbanization, while also shaping the design of our cities.
