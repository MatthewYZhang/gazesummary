Jazz, a distinctly American art form, emerged from the cultural melting pot of late 19th and early 20th century New Orleans. Its development was intertwined with social, economic, and racial dynamics, drawing from African musical traditions, European harmonies, and American blues. The influence of African musical traditions is undeniable, as rhythmic complexity, improvisation, and call-and-response patterns bear a clear resemblance to the music brought by enslaved Africans.

The blues played a crucial role in shaping jazz, expressing the hardships and resilience of African Americans through its emotional depth, use of blue notes, and emphasis on improvisation. New Orleans was the ideal breeding ground for this musical synthesis, with its unique social structure allowing cultural exchange. The music was characterized by improvisation, collective improvisation, and a joyous energy, with key figures like Buddy Bolden defining its early sound. Despite challenges like racial prejudice and social segregation, jazz spread to other cities and developed regional styles, reflecting the unique musical landscape of each new home.
