Coral reefs, recognized as vital marine ecosystems, are intricate underwater structures built by tiny coral polyps. They offer shelter and breeding grounds, sustaining approximately 25% of marine species and playing a key role in coastal protection. However, coral reefs have declined dramatically recently due to human-caused stressors, one of the most significant being climate change. Rising ocean temperatures cause coral bleaching, where corals expel the symbiotic algae and eventually starve. Ocean acidification, another threat linked to climate change, reduces carbonate ions needed for corals to build skeletons. Pollution, which comes from runoff that carries fertilizers and sediments, introduces excessive nutrients and smothers corals. Overfishing, particularly of herbivorous fish, also disrupts the balance. Efforts to protect coral reefs involve marine protected areas and coral restoration projects, which are aimed at increasing coral resilience and adaptation to climate change. Addressing the threats includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting conservation efforts, to secure the future of coral reefs.
