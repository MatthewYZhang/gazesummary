The rise of global communication networks in the late twentieth century marked a new form of interconnectedness centered on information and communication. Distinct from earlier economic networks, this era was characterized by unprecedented speed and reach of information exchange, connecting individuals globally. This expansion was driven by technological revolutions, including the internet, mobile phones, and satellite communication.

Print media and postal services, though limited by speed and geography, were key instruments for centuries. The telegraph in the 19th century marked a significant step forward, enabling near-instantaneous communication, though confined to governmental and commercial use. The twentieth century saw the rise of radio and television broadcasting, primarily one-way communication channels.

The proliferation of personal computers and mobile devices enabled widespread internet access, fostering real-time communication and online communities. Mobile phones have had a profound impact, particularly in developing countries, providing access to voice communication, text messaging, and the internet, while satellite communication has extended the reach of global networks to remote areas. This network facilitates the flow of information and creates opportunities for economic development, but also poses challenges related to privacy and security. Ultimately, it has transformed how people communicate, interact, and access information.
