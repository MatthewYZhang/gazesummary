Coral reefs, known as "rainforests of the sea," stand out as diverse and productive ecosystems, crafted by tiny animals called coral polyps. These underwater structures support a wide array of marine life, holding immense ecological importance despite occupying less than 1% of the ocean floor and supporting 25% of all known marine species. The formation of reefs is a slow and intricate process where polyps secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton that accumulates over time, the polyps harbor symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae provide coral with nutrients through photosynthesis.

Coral reefs are located in warm, shallow, and clear waters in tropical and subtropical regions, where temperature, light, and salinity are essential. The roles of coral reefs are multifaceted, for they serve as breeding grounds, provide shelter, act as natural barriers, and play a crucial role in nutrient cycling. However, reefs face threats from climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive practices, with the nutrient pollution from agricultural runoff and sewage discharge causing algal blooms and overfishing disrupting the reef ecosystem. Addressing these threats and implementing conservation strategies is critical to safeguard these ecosystems.
