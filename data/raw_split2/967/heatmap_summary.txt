The printing press, invented in Europe in the mid-15th century, democratized access to information. Johannes Gutenberg's innovation of movable type made of metal, along with the screw press adopted from winemaking, enabled the rapid production of reusable metal letters using the mold that allowed for the rapid and precise production of individual, reusable metal letters.

The printing press made books more accessible, fueling literacy and intellectual debate as more people had the opportunity to learn to read. The demand for books among the merchant class helped drive the rapid spread of the printing press across Europe, and it was replicated and adopted in various locations because of the relatively simple technology.

The printing press played a pivotal role in the Protestant Reformation, as Martin Luther's writings were quickly distributed. To appeal to a wider audience, printers favored printing in vernacular languages, solidifying national languages and cultures. The Catholic Church attempted to censor books, but despite these efforts, the printing press continued to flourish, revolutionizing the production and distribution of information and laying the foundation for the modern information age.
