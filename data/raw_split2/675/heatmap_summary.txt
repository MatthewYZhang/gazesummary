The dissemination of knowledge before printing was a slow process involving hand-copying by monks, making books precious and limiting the spread of ideas. The first significant printing breakthrough came in China with woodblock printing. This process involved carving text and images onto wood, inking it, and pressing the block onto paper, allowing for more efficient text reproduction. However, it remained labor-intensive, with each page requiring a new block, and the woodblocks were susceptible to wear and tear.

The next major innovation was Johannes Gutenberg's movable type in the mid-15th century. Gutenberg created a system of casting individual letters from metal alloys, which could be arranged to form words and then used to print multiple copies. The reusability of the type was a key advantage, revolutionizing printing by making it faster and more economical. Later printing technologies, such as the steam-powered press, offset printing, and digital printing, further evolved the industry, enabling mass production and personalized publications.
