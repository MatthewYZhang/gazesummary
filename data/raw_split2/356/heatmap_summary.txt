Aquaponics is a sustainable agricultural practice combining aquaculture and hydroponics. This system minimizes waste, reduces water consumption, and eliminates the need for synthetic fertilizers. The key lies in the nitrogen cycle, where fish waste is converted into nitrates by beneficial bacteria, which plants then absorb to clean the water.

The concept is not new, with ancient civilizations employing similar systems, but modern aquaponics emerged in the 1970s and early pioneers experimented with recirculating aquaculture systems. Several aquaponics system designs exist, including deep water culture (DWC) where plant roots are in water.

Aquaponics addresses food security and promotes sustainable agriculture. It can play a crucial role in creating resilient food systems and offering a resource-efficient solution for feeding the global population.
