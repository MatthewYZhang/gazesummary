Jazz music, an American art form, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, rooted in African American traditions like blues and ragtime. Early jazz, known as "Dixieland" or "New Orleans jazz," featured small ensembles improvising melodies with key figures like Buddy Bolden and Jelly Roll Morton shaping the form. As jazz spread, the 1920s brought the "Swing Era" with larger orchestras and arranged music, dominated by Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman. Swing bands highlighted trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and a rhythm section. Later, the emergence of "bebop," with musicians like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, challenged swing with complex harmonies and rapid tempos. The focus shifted to musical expression over danceable rhythms, leading to subgenres like "cool jazz" and "hard bop," incorporating blues and gospel elements. The 1960s saw the rise of "free jazz," challenging traditional harmony, melody, and rhythm, often associated with social causes. Jazz continued to evolve, with "fusion" jazz blending jazz with rock, funk, and world music, pioneered by artists like Miles Davis. Today, jazz remains a vibrant and dynamic art form.
