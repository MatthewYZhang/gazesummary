The collapse of the Maya civilization has intrigued historians, with environmental degradation being a significant factor in their downfall. Their intensive agricultural practices, reliance on natural resources, and drought may have undermined their ability to sustain their population and complex social structures. One major factor was deforestation due to the heavy reliance on wood for construction, fuel, and the production of lime, a key ingredient in their mortar and plaster. This led to increased soil erosion, as the removal of tree cover exposed the soil to the elements. Eroded soil washed into rivers and lakes, polluting water sources and reducing agricultural productivity. The loss of tree cover reduced local rainfall, leading to drier conditions and decreased crop yields.

Another factor was their intensive agricultural practices, which included terracing, irrigation, and raised fields. However, these practices could lead to soil depletion and salinization. The Maya also experienced prolonged droughts during the Terminal Classic period, which stressed their agricultural system. Environmental degradation, particularly deforestation and drought, contributed to the Maya's decline by undermining their ability to sustain their population.
