Sleep, a fundamental biological process with reduced awareness, remains a subject of scientific investigation despite its ubiquity. One prevailing theory emphasizes sleep's restorative role, facilitating the clearance of metabolic byproducts from the brain that accumulate during waking hours, which can interfere with neuronal function. Sleep deprivation can impair cognitive performance and increase susceptibility to illness. Another important function appears to be memory consolidation, where sleep plays a crucial role in transferring information from short-term to long-term memory. The body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, is a 24-hour cycle that regulates sleep-wake patterns and is influenced by light and darkness. Melatonin, produced by the pineal gland, regulates the circadian rhythm and promotes sleep, with levels rising in the evening as darkness approaches. Other factors influencing sleep are adenosine which accumulates in the brain and also strategies for improving sleep including maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine.
