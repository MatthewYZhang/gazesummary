The ability to fly has evolved independently in insects, birds, and bats. Birds represent a case study in this, showcasing a transformation from dinosaurs to aerial masters. While the fossil record is incomplete, the evolutionary stages and selective pressures of avian flight are being understood. It is questioned whether bird flight originated "from the trees down" (arboreal hypothesis) or "from the ground up" (cursorial hypothesis). The arboreal hypothesis suggests early proto-birds used developing wings for gliding from trees, eventually leading to flight. Evidence for this includes curved claws on early bird fossils. Conversely, the cursorial hypothesis proposes that flight evolved from running predators using feathered forelimbs for balance, leading to lift. It is possible both scenarios played a role.

Feathers are a crucial adaptation for flight, initially evolving for insulation or display and, later, to generate lift and thrust. The shape of flight feathers is crucial for creating lift. A lightweight skeleton with hollow bones reduced the energy cost of flight. The skeletal structure is specialized for flight, with the fusion of bones providing support and flexibility and a keeled sternum providing a surface area for flight muscles. The arrangement of flight muscles allows for efficient flapping. The respiratory system of birds has a unidirectional flow of air, essential for flight, and the circulatory system ensures oxygen delivery.
