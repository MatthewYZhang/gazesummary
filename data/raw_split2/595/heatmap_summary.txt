Invasive species have a significant impact on island ecosystems due to their vulnerability and unique biodiversity. Island ecosystems are susceptible to invasive species because of isolation, evolutionary history, and limited biodiversity. These species can alter island ecosystems through predation, competition, and the introduction of diseases. Introduced predators like rats, cats, and snakes can decimate native populations of birds, reptiles, and mammals, as seen with the brown tree snake in Guam. Invasive plants also outcompete native vegetation, leading to habitat structure alteration. Avian malaria, transmitted by introduced mosquitoes, has caused the extinction of several native bird species in Hawaii. Prevention is the most effective way to address the threat of invasive species. Eradication, involving the complete removal of the invasive species, is the most effective way to restore the ecosystem. Effective prevention and control measures can ensure the long-term survival of island ecosystems.
