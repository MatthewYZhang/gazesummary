Sleep is a complex and active physiological state essential for cognitive performance, immune function, and overall physical health. It consists of distinct stages categorized into NREM and REM sleep. NREM sleep includes stages N1, N2, and N3, each representing a progressively deeper level. N1 is a transition from wakefulness to sleep, N2 is characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes, and N3, or slow-wave sleep (SWS), is crucial for physical restoration and memory consolidation. The timing and duration of sleep are regulated by the circadian rhythm, influencing hormone secretion, body temperature, and sleep-wake patterns. The master circadian clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which receives direct input from the eyes. Exposure to light, especially blue light, can influence the SCN. Sleep is also regulated by homeostatic sleep drive, with adenosine accumulating in the brain during wakefulness to promote sleepiness. Chronic sleep deprivation can impair cognitive function, weaken the immune system, and increase the risk of chronic diseases.
