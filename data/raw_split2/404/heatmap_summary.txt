The Mayan civilization, noted for its advanced mathematics, astronomy, and art, flourished in Mesoamerica for centuries before its enigmatic decline. The Maya were organized into a series of independent city-states spread across present-day Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.

The rise of the Mayan civilization can be traced back to the Preclassic period (2000 BC - 250 AD), during which they developed agriculture based on maize, beans, and squash. The Classic period (250 AD - 900 AD) marked the peak of Mayan civilization, with sophisticated writing systems, accurate calendars, and impressive architectural achievements.

The Classic period came to an end with the mysterious collapse of many Mayan city-states in the southern lowlands around 900 AD. The reasons for this collapse are still debated by scholars, suggesting that environmental degradation, climate change, warfare, political instability, and trade disruptions may have contributed. However, the Mayan civilization persisted in the northern Yucatan Peninsula, but the Mayan civilization never regained its former glory, and the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century marked the end of their independence.
