Animal navigation is an intricate ability exhibited by many species, from birds and insects to fish and mammals, often involving long-distance migrations. How animals navigate vast, unfamiliar landscapes and seascapes is a fundamental question, with the answer involving a combination of sensory cues, innate predispositions, and learned behaviors. The Earth's magnetic field is a key navigational tool for species like migratory birds and sea turtles, which possess an internal compass allowing them to detect and orient themselves using magnetic lines of force. Specialized cells containing magnetite are believed to play a role in sensing the magnetic field's direction and intensity. Animals may also use variations in the Earthâ€™s magnetic field to create mental maps.

Beyond magnetism, other cues such as visual landmarks and the position of the sun and stars help animals navigate. Olfaction also plays a significant role, for example, salmon are able to return to their natal streams using the unique chemical signature of the water. Research also focuses on how animals create a coherent mental map to compensate for environmental challenges. A deeper understanding of animal navigation can help protect migratory routes and habitats.
