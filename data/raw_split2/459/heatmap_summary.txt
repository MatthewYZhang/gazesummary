The 1920s, marked by the rise of consumer culture in America, resulted in mass production, changing the way Americans lived, as focus shifted from production to consumption. One key element was the rise of mass production, with Henry Ford's assembly line revolutionizing manufacturing and making goods like automobiles and home appliances more affordable. These appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, promised to liberate homemakers and connect families to information. Advertising emerged to appeal to emotions, promising social acceptance through consumer goods. Leisure activities, along with the rise of cinema and music, commercialized. The rise of the "flapper" symbolized newfound freedom. Suburbs grew, with the automobile transforming urban planning. The consumerism of the 1920s was criticized for its materialism, fostering conformity and undermining traditional values. The stock market crash of 1929 marked the end of the Roaring Twenties and forced Americans to re-evaluate priorities; however, consumer culture left a legacy on American society.
