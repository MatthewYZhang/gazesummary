Antibiotics, initially hailed as miracle drugs, have revolutionized medicine but their widespread use has fostered antibiotic resistance, posing a global health threat. Bacteria develop mechanisms to evade antibiotics, escalating the problem to alarming levels. The development of antibiotic resistance is a natural consequence of evolution, where susceptible bacteria are killed by antibiotics, while resistant bacteria survive and proliferate, passing on advantageous genes. Horizontal gene transfer accelerates the spread of resistance genes.

Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture drive antibiotic resistance, along with poor sanitation and hygiene practices. The consequences of antibiotic resistance include difficult-to-treat infections, prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms such as MRSA and CRE.

Addressing antibiotic resistance requires a multifaceted approach, including antibiotic stewardship programs and public awareness campaigns to promote responsible antibiotic use and prevent the spread of resistant bacteria. Improved sanitation and hygiene practices, international collaboration, and surveillance systems are essential for tracking and managing resistance. By adopting a comprehensive approach, we can slow the spread of resistance and preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics. The fight against antibiotic resistance requires a sustained and concerted effort from healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public.
