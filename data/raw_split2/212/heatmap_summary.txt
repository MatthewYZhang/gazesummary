The Ancestral Puebloans, also known as the Anasazi, were a prehistoric Native American civilization that thrived in the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States from approximately 750 to 1300 CE. They emerged from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, gradually adopting agriculture around the first century CE. The primary crop of the Anasazi was corn, supplemented by beans and squash, which allowed for population growth and complex social structures. This agricultural revolution enabled the development of settled villages and more complex social structures. Chaco Canyon became the center of the Anasazi civilization between approximately 850 and 1150 CE.

However, in the late 12th century, the Anasazi civilization in Chaco Canyon began to decline due to environmental factors, including a prolonged drought and deforestation. The descendants of the Anasazi, including the modern-day Pueblo peoples, maintain many of the traditions and cultural practices of their ancestors.
