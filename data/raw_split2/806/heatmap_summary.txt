Coral reefs are vibrant ecosystems that provide habitat, shelter, and food for marine organisms, while also supporting coastal communities. However, they face threats leading to degradation and decline. Rising ocean temperatures, a consequence of climate change, drive coral bleaching, where corals expel symbiotic algae, resulting in pale and weakened corals. Ocean acidification, caused by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, reduces carbonate ions needed for corals to build skeletons, weakening coral structures. Pollution from land-based sources also causes coral decline by leading to algal blooms and suffocation. Overfishing and destructive fishing practices damage coral structures and disrupt the reef ecosystem. Disease outbreaks contribute to coral reef decline, and their causes are not fully understood. Efforts to protect coral reefs include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving land-use practices, and implementing sustainable fishing practices. Coral restoration efforts can help rebuild damaged reefs. The future of coral reefs depends on action to address climate change, reduce pollution, and promote sustainable fishing practices.
