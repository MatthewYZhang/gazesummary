From its origins in the highlands of Ethiopia, coffee has transformed into a global phenomenon. Legend says that an Ethiopian goat herder, Kaldi, noticed his goats' increased energy after they consumed coffee berries, revealing the beans' stimulating properties. From Ethiopia, coffee spread to Yemen, where Sufi mystics used it during religious rituals. By the 15th century, coffee houses, called "qahveh khaneh," emerged across the Arabian Peninsula as centers for social and intellectual activity. These houses were not just places to drink but spaces for conversation and debate. The development of instant coffee and the rise of large coffee chains, such as Starbucks, significantly increased coffee consumption. Instant coffee made the beverage more accessible, and coffee chains created a distinct atmosphere. "Third-wave coffee" emphasizes quality and the barista's skill, leading to appreciation for flavor and sustainable practices. Today, coffee remains a symbol of connection and community.
