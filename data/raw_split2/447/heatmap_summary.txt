Coffee cultivation, originating in the highlands of Ethiopia, has expanded globally, influencing economies, cultures, and environments. The success of coffee lies in its adaptable cultivation strategies. Initially localized in Ethiopia and Yemen, cultivation began in Yemen by the 15th century, establishing the Arabian Peninsula as an early center. Mocha became synonymous with the coffee trade, and coffee houses emerged as social and intellectual hubs in the Middle East.

European interest grew in the 17th century, with smugglers and traders integral to its dissemination. Despite efforts to protect the monopoly by exporting only roasted beans, unroasted beans reached Europe. The Dutch established coffee plantations in their colonies, starting with Java.

Coffee cultivation requires specific environmental conditions such as high altitudes, consistent rainfall, and mild temperatures. Shade-grown coffee promotes biodiversity, but intensive sun-grown plantations have led to deforestation. The story of coffee cultivation is one of global exchange, adaptation, and resilience. Sustainable practices are needed to ensure its long-term viability.
