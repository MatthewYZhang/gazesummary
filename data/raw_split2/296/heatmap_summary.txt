Invasive species, also known as alien, exotic, or non-native species, represent a significant threat to ecosystems worldwide, disrupting the ecological balance and potentially driving native species to extinction. Understanding their impact requires examining their spread and management.

The success of invasive species hinges on the absence of natural predators, parasites, or diseases, which allows them to proliferate rapidly. Many invasive species can adapt quickly to new environments due to high reproductive rates, broad diets, and tolerance to diverse conditions. Human activities facilitate their spread through global trade and transportation. The ecological consequences include competition for resources. Invasive plants can colonize areas, reducing biodiversity. Invasive animals may prey on native species or introduce diseases.

Biological control involves introducing natural enemies, but carries risks. Habitat restoration is crucial for managing invasive species. Long-term success requires a multifaceted approach and collaboration among scientists, policymakers, and the public. Mitigating the threat necessitates a global perspective.
