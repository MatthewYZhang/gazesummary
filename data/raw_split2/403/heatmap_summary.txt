The common understanding of the natural world often paints a picture of fierce competition and self-preservation. However, closer examination reveals instances of altruism, behaviors that benefit others at a cost to oneself, challenging this view.  The existence and evolution of altruism has been a subject of intense investigation. One explanation for altruistic behavior is kin selection, championed by W.D. Hamilton, which proposes that individuals are more likely to behave altruistically towards relatives because they share genes.  Hamilton's rule predicts when kin selection is likely, based on relatedness, cost, and benefit. While kin selection explains altruism within families, it doesn't account for altruism towards unrelated individuals.

Reciprocal altruism, by Robert Trivers, explains altruism among non-relatives, suggesting individuals act altruistically with the expectation of reciprocation.  For reciprocal altruism to evolve, individuals must recognize others, remember past interactions, and punish non-reciprocators. Reciprocal altruism can be vulnerable to cheating, making mechanisms for detecting and punishing cheaters essential. Psychological research explores the motivations behind human altruism, with one perspective attributing it to empathy. When witnessing suffering, we may alleviate distress.  However, some researchers argue that altruism is often motivated by self-interest, like gaining approval or avoiding guilt.  The debate continues whether altruism is fundamentally selfish or selfless.

Although, it has been shown that even altruistic acts can be manipulated for personal gain. Thus, there is a degree of cynicism with the nature of the term "altruism."
The nature of altruism remains a complex and fascinating topic.
