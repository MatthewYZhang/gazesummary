Dams, built for various purposes like irrigation and hydroelectric power, significantly impact river ecosystems. They alter the natural flow regime, leading to a more regulated flow by storing water during high flow periods and releasing it at different times. This disruption can negatively affect fish migrations and habitat availability. Dams also trap sediment, preventing it from reaching downstream, which results in erosion and loss of floodplain habitats.

Dams impact fish populations by obstructing migrations, despite mitigation attempts with fish ladders. Reservoirs created by dams alter aquatic communities and can release greenhouse gases. While dams' impacts are generally negative, mitigation measures such as mimicking natural flow regimes and managing sediment accumulation can reduce their severity. Dam removal can restore ecosystems but is a complex decision involving weighing the benefits of water resource management against ecological costs. Ultimately, understanding the ecological impacts is essential for balancing human needs with river health.
