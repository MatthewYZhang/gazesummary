Mycorrhizae represent a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant and is ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems, playing a vital role in plant nutrition, soil health, and overall ecosystem functioning, influencing plant survival, growth, and even community composition. There are two primary types: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form a sheath around the plant root and extend hyphae into the surrounding soil, increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption, facilitating the uptake of nutrients from decomposing organic matter and also protect roots from pathogens. The benefits of mycorrhizal associations are numerous, including improved nutrient uptake by extending fungal hyphae far beyond the nutrient depletion zone, which can enhance plant water absorption, improve tolerance to drought, and increase resistance to soil-borne pathogens. 

This interconnectedness can create a more resilient and stable ecosystem. However, human activities, such as intensive agriculture, deforestation, and pollution, can disrupt mycorrhizal associations, leading to cascading effects on plant health, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem functioning. Inoculating crops with beneficial mycorrhizal fungi can improve yields and reduce the need for fertilizers. By understanding and harnessing the power of mycorrhizae, we can promote sustainable agriculture, conserve biodiversity, and enhance the resilience of our planet's ecosystems.
