The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica from 250 to 900 CE and developed a sophisticated society with urban centers, complex social hierarchies, and rich cultural traditions, organized around independent city-states ruled by divine kings. The Maya developed a hieroglyphic writing system, used to record history and astronomical observations. They built monumental architecture and developed sophisticated irrigation systems, along with mathematics and astronomy that allowed them to create accurate calendars. They were known for their political, religious, and economic activity. Agriculture formed the backbone of the Maya economy, with intensive farming techniques. The Maya collapse is attributed to prolonged periods of drought, deforestation, soil erosion, and unsustainable agricultural practices which may have led to food shortages and unrest. A combination of environmental degradation, internal conflict, and disease are likely to have contributed to the decline. After the Classic Maya civilization's collapse, some Maya populations migrated to the Yucat√°n Peninsula and established new city-states. The Maya people persisted and continue to live in Mesoamerica, preserving their culture.
