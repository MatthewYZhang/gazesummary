Cahokia, a significant Mississippian center located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois, emerged around 800 CE as part of a dramatic shift marked by intensive maize agriculture, hierarchical social structures, and monumental earthworks. This Mississippian tradition flourished in the fertile river valleys of the Mississippi, Ohio, and Missouri, with Cahokia becoming the largest urban center north of Mexico in pre-Columbian North America. Around 1050 CE, Cahokia experienced a period of rapid growth, fueled by surplus maize production, which allowed for specialization of labor and the development of a complex social hierarchy. Archaeological excavations at Cahokia have revealed a sophisticated understanding of astronomy and engineering. Despite its decline, Cahokia left an indelible mark on the landscape. Today, Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting visitors from around the world who come to marvel at the legacy of this ancient metropolis.
