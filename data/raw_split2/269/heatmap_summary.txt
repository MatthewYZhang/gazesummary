Perspective in art involves manipulating our perception of reality through visual techniques. Artists have long employed perspective to manipulate and challenge our perception of space, depth, and the world around us. Linear perspective, developed during the Renaissance, involves parallel lines converging at a vanishing point on the horizon to create a sense of depth, as seen in the works of Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. Atmospheric perspective, also known as aerial perspective, relies on gradations of color and tone to create depth, often using fainter, less detailed, and bluer colors to suggest distance, as used by artists such as J.M.W. Turner and Claude Monet. Beyond these traditional techniques, artists use various distortions of perspective to challenge our assumptions about reality, while unconventional perspectives, such as bird's-eye and worm's-eye views, offer alternative ways of seeing the world. The use of perspective is not merely a technique; it is a tool for exploring the subjective and ever-changing nature of human experience.
