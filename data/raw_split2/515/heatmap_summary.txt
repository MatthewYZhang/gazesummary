Cloud cover significantly affects the sun's energy, vital for plant growth and global temperatures. Clouds act as both barriers and facilitators of solar radiation, and their role in climate change prediction is crucial. They reduce the energy available for plant growth by reflecting incoming solar radiation. Albedo, the reflective property, varies based on cloud type, thickness, and altitude. Different light wavelengths are affected, and the scattering of shorter (blue) wavelengths contributes to diffused light. Plants adapt to reduced sunlight intensity by increasing chlorophyll or altering leaf structure, but prolonged cloud cover can reduce growth, particularly in short-season regions. Clouds can also moderate temperature extremes, reduce water stress by limiting direct sunlight, and slow transpiration. Furthermore, cloud cover helps create a more uniform light distribution, potentially improving photosynthesis. Climate change altering cloud patterns could cause shifts in ecosystems, impacting plant distribution and productivity. Understanding this interplay is crucial for effective mitigation strategies.
