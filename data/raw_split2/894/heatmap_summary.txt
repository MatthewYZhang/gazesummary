Social media platforms have reshaped political discourse, extending discussions beyond traditional media. However, this increased accessibility brings challenges, including echo chambers created by algorithms that prioritize user-aligned content, potentially increasing polarization and hindering constructive dialogue, with individuals becoming entrenched in their beliefs and less willing to consider alternative viewpoints. Misinformation spread on social media poses a serious threat, as false information can quickly go viral and influence public opinion.

Furthermore, social media has altered political discourse, often emphasizing emotional appeals over reasoned arguments. Platforms like Twitter can oversimplify complex issues. While social media has negative aspects, it can also be a valuable tool for political mobilization and citizen journalism. Ultimately, addressing challenges like echo chambers and misinformation is crucial for fostering healthy political discourse.
