Each year, billions of birds undertake extraordinary journeys, traversing vast distances between their breeding and wintering grounds. The routes that migratory birds follow are often remarkably consistent, with individuals returning to the same breeding and wintering locations year after year. These routes can span continents, encompassing diverse habitats ranging from arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. Some birds undertake incredible non-stop flights lasting for days or even weeks, relying solely on stored fat reserves to fuel their journey. The bar-tailed godwit, for instance, holds the record for the longest known non-stop flight by a land bird, covering over 7,000 miles from Alaska to New Zealand. By moving to different locations at different times of the year, birds can exploit seasonal resources and avoid harsh environmental conditions. However, migration also exposes birds to a variety of threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and collisions with human-made structures. As human activities continue to alter the environment, it is crucial to understand the impacts of these changes on migratory birds and to develop effective conservation strategies to protect these remarkable species.
