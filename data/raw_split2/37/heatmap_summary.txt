Coral reefs, "rainforests of the sea," are diverse and productive ecosystems, supporting approximately 25% of all marine life, playing a critical role in maintaining ocean health and biodiversity. Reef formation starts with a coral polyp, which creates a calcium carbonate exoskeleton forming the reef's base. New polyps build upon the skeletons of dead ones, creating three-dimensional structures. Hard corals build reefs, while soft corals are flexible and do not contribute to reef structure.

Coral reefs thrive in warm, shallow, clear waters, where symbiotic algae provide up to 90% of the coral's energy through photosynthesis, receiving protection in return. Fringing reefs are the most common, growing directly from the shoreline. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia is the largest barrier reef. Coral reefs face threats from human activities and climate change. Ocean acidification inhibits corals' ability to build skeletons, and rising sea temperatures cause coral bleaching. Efforts to protect and restore reefs are crucial for preserving biodiversity.
