Atolls, ring-shaped coral reefs that encircle lagoons, are captivating features of tropical oceans. Darwin's theory links their formation to the subsidence of volcanic islands, a cornerstone understanding refined by modern research. Darwin hypothesized that atolls begin as fringing reefs around volcanic islands; as the volcano sinks, the reef grows upwards. The outer reef edges flourish due to the constant supply of nutrients and oxygen, while the inner portion grows more slowly. As the volcanic island continues to sink, the fringing reef becomes a barrier reef, separated by a widening lagoon. Eventually, the island submerges, leaving the ring-shaped reef and central lagoon, a complex ecosystem. However, the rate of subsidence, volcanic rock type, ocean currents, and sea level fluctuations all play crucial roles in shaping atolls. Erosion and sedimentation also influence their final form. The role of sea level changes, the study of atoll sediments, and bioerosion also contribute to atoll's development. Overall, the formation of atolls is complex, requiring consideration of subsidence, sea level changes, erosion, sedimentation, and bioerosion.
