Phantom limbs involve vivid sensations like pain in a missing limb, a phenomenon experienced by amputees. One theory suggests neural reorganization in the brain, where the brain region previously responsible for sensory input from the amputated limb is rewired, causing misinterpretation of signals. For example, if the brain area responsible for the hand is taken over by the face, touching the face might be interpreted as a sensation in the missing hand. Another theory explains that even after the limb is lost, the brain may retain a map leading to a persistent sensation of the limb's presence. The persistence of sensory memories plays a role. A third explanation focuses on the peripheral nervous system, and nerves in the stump forming neuromas generate electrical activity misperceived by the brain. Mirror therapy and virtual reality are leading to new treatments.
