Islands are isolated environments that harbor unique ecosystems, making them biodiversity hotspots. However, this isolation also makes them vulnerable to invasive species, as island species often lack the defenses to survive the arrival of foreign organisms. This vulnerability can lead to devastating impacts, including habitat degradation, population declines, and even extinctions. Invasive species can reach islands through various pathways, including ships carrying stowaways like rats, mice, insects, and diseases. Increased global trade and tourism have accelerated the rate of invasions. Intentional introductions, such as mongooses in the Caribbean to control rats, have also contributed to the problem, leading to the decline of native species. Controlling invasive species requires strict biosecurity measures, early detection, and rapid response. While challenging, eradication efforts, as seen with goats and rats on some islands, can be successful. Ultimately, protecting island ecosystems requires a multifaceted approach.
