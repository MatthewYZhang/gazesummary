The article explores the significance of turquoise and copper in the American Southwest and cylinder seals in ancient Mesopotamia, revealing their roles in social, religious, and political structures. Turquoise and copper were used from around A.D. 200 until the arrival of the Spanish, and their importance stems from their visual appeal, with turquoise fashioned into ornaments signifying prestige and copper crafted into bells. The acquisition and working of these materials demanded specialized knowledge and labor, and their visual qualities were deliberately enhanced. These distinctions established hierarchies within ritual contexts, where larger pendants were reserved for higher-ranked individuals. Cylinder seals in Mesopotamia held significance beyond their functional purpose, serving as symbols of identity and status. They were used to seal documents and depict scenes from mythology, reflecting the owner's name, profession, and beliefs. The creation of these seals was labor-intensive, with meticulous craftsmanship and the choice of materials enhancing their visual impact. Visual distinctions in cylinder seals were not only about individual identity but also about social hierarchy, with elaborate seals belonging to rulers and high-ranking officials. These seals communicated power and authority.
