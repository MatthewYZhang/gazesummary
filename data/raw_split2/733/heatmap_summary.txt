The pre-Columbian city of Cahokia stands as a testament to the societies that flourished in North America. Understanding the factors contributing to Cahokia's rise and fall is a question for archaeologists and historians, with environmental impact increasingly recognized.

Cahokia emerged around AD 1050, becoming the largest urban center north of Mexico with an estimated 10,000-20,000 inhabitants. Its impressive earthen mounds served as platforms for residences, temples, and structures. However, by the 14th century, Cahokia was largely abandoned for reasons including deforestation, which led to soil erosion, decreased water quality, and reduced availability of essential resources. The Mississippian culture relied heavily on corn agriculture, and a prolonged drought could have led to crop failures, food shortages, and social unrest. The decline of Cahokia was likely a complex interplay of environmental, social, and political factors, making it a cautionary tale about unsustainable resource management.
