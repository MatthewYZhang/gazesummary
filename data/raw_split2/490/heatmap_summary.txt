Coral reefs, often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," are exceptionally diverse and productive ecosystems found in warm, shallow, tropical, and subtropical waters. These vibrant habitats are formed by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps, which secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton. Over thousands of years, this skeleton accumulates to create the intricate structures that define coral reefs.

A crucial aspect of coral reef ecology is the symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and microscopic algae called zooxanthellae. These algae live within the coral tissues, providing the coral with up to 90% of their energy needs through photosynthesis. In return, the coral offers the algae a protected environment and access to sunlight. This mutually beneficial relationship gives corals their vibrant colors and fuels their rapid growth. Coral reefs are threatened by human activities and climate change, with rising ocean temperatures leading to coral bleaching when corals expel their zooxanthellae. Scientists and conservationists are working on strategies to protect and restore coral reefs, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, implementing sustainable fishing practices, and reducing pollution.
