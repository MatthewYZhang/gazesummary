Bird migration is a fascinating behavior in which birds seasonally move between breeding and non-breeding areas in response to variations in resource availability. The triggers for migration include changes in day length, temperature, food availability, and hormonal cues. Birds experience physiological changes, such as increased fat deposition, to fuel their long flights. Different species have evolved distinct migration strategies with some undertaking long flights and others breaking their journeys into shorter hops.

Navigating requires sophisticated orientation mechanisms, including the Earth's magnetic field, the sun and stars, visual landmarks, and olfactory cues. The study of bird migration offers insights into ecological and evolutionary processes and reminds us of the interconnectedness of our planet. Despite facing challenges like energy expenditure and human-induced threats, migratory birds exhibit resilience and adaptability, highlighting the importance of migration in bird ecology. Conserving migratory birds requires international cooperation to protect their habitats along their entire migratory routes.
