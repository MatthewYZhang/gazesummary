Crowd psychology examines how an individual's psychological state changes within a crowd, drawing from social psychology and sociology. Early theories, particularly Gustave Le Bon's, suggested that individuals in crowds lose personal identity and rationality, developing a "collective mind" characterized by suggestibility and irrationality. This makes them more susceptible to manipulation and less capable of critical thought. While Le Bon's ideas have been criticized, they have laid the foundation for subsequent research. A key concept is deindividuation, where individuals lose self-awareness and personal responsibility. Other concepts include how norms emerge through interaction, observation, and leadership. Leaders can influence crowd behavior by articulating a clear message, providing direction, and setting an example. Modern research has moved beyond simplistic notions of crowd irrationality, considering social context and individual motivations, providing insights into crowd formation and behavior.
