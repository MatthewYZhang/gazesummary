The Maya civilization, known for its advancements, flourished in Mesoamerica for over a millennium. The Maya’s story is one of innovation and decline, leaving a legacy that inspires awe. The origins of the Maya can be traced back to the Preclassic period (c. 2000 BCE – 250 CE), with early settlements evolving into complex societies. During this time, the Maya developed a sophisticated agricultural system, relying heavily on maize cultivation, as well as beans, squash, and other crops. This agricultural surplus supported a growing population and allowed for the emergence of a social hierarchy, with ruling elites and specialized artisans.  The Classic period (c. 250 – 900 CE) marks the zenith of Maya civilization, while the Postclassic period saw the rise of new city-states. Despite centuries of oppression, the Maya people have maintained their cultural identity and fight for their rights and recognition. Today, millions of Maya people live in Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador.
