Specialty coffee represents a shift from commodity coffee, which was mass-produced and brewed primarily for its stimulating effects, towards a focus on quality, origin, and brewing techniques. Specialty coffee emphasizes the unique characteristics of coffee beans grown in specific regions and under specific conditions, with factors like altitude and soil composition playing a crucial role in determining the flavor profile. Unlike commodity coffee, specialty coffee is often sourced from single estates or small cooperatives. The shift towards specialty coffee has also led to a demand for more sophisticated roasting techniques, with roasters tailoring roast profiles to specific origins and varieties. Brewing methods have evolved as well, with traditional drip coffee makers being supplemented by manual pour-over devices and espresso machines. The rise of specialty coffee has also led to a greater appreciation for the complexity and diversity of coffee and represents a move towards quality and sustainability.
