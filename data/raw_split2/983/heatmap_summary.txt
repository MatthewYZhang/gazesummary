The Cambrian Explosion, which occurred roughly 541 million years ago, marks a pivotal moment in Earth's history, witnessing an unprecedented diversification of life forms and the sudden appearance of most major animal phyla, including those with hard skeletons and complex body plans. Before this period, life was primarily simple, soft-bodied organisms, and the reasons behind this evolutionary burst remain a subject of intense debate. One hypothesis centers on the rise in atmospheric oxygen levels during the late Precambrian and early Cambrian, which may have provided the metabolic fuel necessary for larger, more active organisms with complex tissues and organs and facilitated the formation of ozone, shielding life from harmful ultraviolet radiation.

The Cambrian explosion has profound implications for our understanding of evolution and the history of life on Earth. The fossil record, while rich, is incomplete. Nevertheless, ongoing research using paleontology, molecular biology, and developmental genetics is gradually filling in the gaps in our knowledge. The ongoing study continues to challenge scientists.
