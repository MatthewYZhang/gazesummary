Coral reefs, complex communities built by coral polyps, are inextricably linked to symbiotic relationships. A crucial partnership involves coral polyps and zooxanthellae, where algae provide the coral with essential nutrients through photosynthesis. The coral, in turn, gives algae protection, access to sunlight, and raw materials. Coral bleaching occurs when stressed corals expel the algae. The vibrant colors of coral are largely due to the presence of zooxanthellae.

Reefs have cleaning symbiosis where cleaner wrasses eat parasites from larger fish. This arrangement maintains the health of both populations. Sponges filter water, maintaining water clarity important for coral health. Bacteria in reefs cycle nutrients and protect corals from disease.

However, coral reefs are facing threats from human activities such as climate change, pollution, and destructive fishing practices. Improving wastewater treatment and reducing agricultural runoff can help minimize pollution.
