Tourism significantly impacts island ecosystems, posing threats like habitat destruction through infrastructure development such as hotels and airports, which leads to clearing land and loss of natural habitats. This directly threatens endemic species and disrupts ecological balances, where critical ecosystems like mangrove forests and coral reefs are destroyed. Pollution due to increased waste, sewage, and air emissions further harms wildlife and contaminates resources, causing algal blooms that devastate coral reefs. Overexploitation of resources, including water, food, and marine life for souvenirs and restaurants, strains local ecosystems, impacting traditional livelihoods. Strategies to mitigate these negative impacts include sustainable planning, environmental regulations, eco-certification, community involvement, and education. Effective management requires a holistic approach, balancing economic development with environmental protection to ensure the sustainability of island ecosystems for future generations.
