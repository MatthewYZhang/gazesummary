Jazz, a uniquely American art form, is characterized by improvisation, syncopation, and a strong rhythmic foundation. Its roots lie in the rich musical traditions of African Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, drawing from blues, ragtime, and European musical structures. The evolution of jazz is a complex story of cultural exchange, innovation, and social change.

Early jazz, often referred to as Dixieland or New Orleans jazz, emerged in the early 1900s in the diverse cultural melting pot of New Orleans. This style featured collective improvisation, where multiple instruments such as trumpet, clarinet, and trombone, would simultaneously create melodic lines over a rhythmic foundation. Prominent figures like Louis Armstrong helped to popularize this style.

The post-World War II era brought about a radical shift in jazz with the emergence of bebop. This complex and virtuosic style, pioneered by musicians like Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, emphasized rapid tempos, intricate harmonies, and extended improvisations.
