The Oort Cloud, a theoretical spherical shell of icy bodies, is believed to be the source of long-period comets that follow highly eccentric paths into the inner solar system. Named after Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, who first proposed its existence, it is hypothesized to lie between 2,000 and 200,000 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun.

Estimates suggest it contains trillions of icy bodies, remnants from the early solar system's formation. Computer simulations support this, showing that giant planets scattered planetesimals outwards, with some ejected and others placed in elongated orbits, which were further perturbed by the gravitational influence of passing stars.

The mass of the Oort Cloud, estimated to be between a few to hundreds of Earth masses, remains a mystery due to the lack of direct observations and modeling difficulties. This mass is important for understanding the early solar system's composition and dynamics, as a larger mass suggests more icy planetesimals during planet formation. Evidence for the Oort Cloud comes from the orbits of long-period comets, which appear to originate from beyond the planets. It is also suggested the Oort Cloud could act as a buffer, shielding the inner solar system.
