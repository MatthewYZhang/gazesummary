The discovery of antibiotics in the 20th century revolutionized medicine, offering unprecedented control over bacterial infections. These drugs target essential bacterial processes, effectively halting their growth or killing them outright. However, the widespread use of antibiotics has inadvertently fueled a crisis: the rise of antibiotic resistance.

Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria evolve mechanisms to evade the effects of antibiotics, which is a natural process driven by evolutionary pressures. Bacteria can quickly accumulate genetic mutations and confer resistance to specific antibiotics. In the presence of antibiotics, susceptible bacteria are killed off, while resistant strains survive and proliferate, ultimately becoming dominant.

Several factors contribute to the acceleration of antibiotic resistance. Overuse of antibiotics in human medicine is a primary driver. In agriculture, antibiotics are routinely administered to livestock to promote growth and prevent disease. Poor sanitation and hygiene practices further facilitate the spread of resistant bacteria.

Some bacteria develop efflux pumps that actively expel antibiotics from the bacterial cell, reducing their intracellular concentration.

Addressing the antibiotic resistance crisis requires a multifaceted approach. A coordinated and sustained effort is essential to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics and safeguard public health for future generations.
