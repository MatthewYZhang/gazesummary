The Great Serpent Mound in Ohio is an enigmatic earthwork depicting a serpent swallowing an egg, stretching over 1,300 feet. It’s a remarkable feat of engineering, raising questions about its builders and purpose, and notably lacks burial sites or artifacts. The mound's shape conforms to the natural topography, with the serpent's head facing east and tail coiling into a triple spiral to the west, and an oval feature near the mouth measures approximately 120 feet, often viewed as an egg or the sun. It has been debated whether the Adena culture or the Fort Ancient culture was responsible for building the Great Serpent Mound. The purpose of the Great Serpent Mound remains speculative with theories ranging from astronomical alignments to symbolic representations. The serpent’s head is thought to point towards the sunrise on the summer solstice. The act of swallowing an egg may represent the rebirth of the sun or the continuation of life. The mound continues to withhold its secrets and remains a unique archaeological site.
