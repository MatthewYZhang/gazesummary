Jazz is a genre born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in New Orleans, Louisiana. It features the fusion of African rhythms, European harmonies, and American spirituals. Early jazz, or "Dixieland," featured small ensembles playing collectively improvised melodies with instruments like the trumpet, clarinet, trombone, and banjo.

The 1920s, known as the "Jazz Age," marked the rapid spread of jazz. Cities like Chicago and New York became hubs for jazz musicians. Swing music emerged with larger ensembles, arranged compositions, and a strong emphasis on dance rhythms.

Cool jazz offered a subdued and melodic approach, emphasizing lyrical improvisation. Hard bop retained the intensity of bebop, and modal jazz, explored the use of musical modes. Jazz diversified into subgenres such as free jazz, fusion, and smooth jazz. Today, jazz continues to evolve, incorporating hip-hop, electronic music, and world music, and is promoted through jazz education programs.
