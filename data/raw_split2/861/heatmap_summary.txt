Coral reefs, often called "rainforests of the sea," are thriving underwater ecosystems that support about 25% of all marine life. These structures provide shelter, breeding areas, and feeding grounds. Beyond their ecological importance, they offer economic benefits, supporting fisheries, tourism, and coastal protection. However, coral reefs are facing an unprecedented crisis, characterized by widespread coral bleaching events and declines in reef health.

Coral bleaching, a primary driver of reef decline, is a stress response due to changes in environmental conditions, especially increased water temperatures. Corals have a relationship with zooxanthellae that live within their tissues. When exposed to elevated temperatures, corals expel the algae, causing them to turn white. Bleached corals are weakened, more susceptible to disease, and less able to grow and reproduce. Climate change, driven by greenhouse gases, is the primary cause of rising ocean temperatures. Ocean acidification, pollution, and overfishing also threaten coral reefs, impacting biodiversity, livelihoods, and coastal protection. Overfishing can disrupt the balance of reef ecosystems by removing key predators and herbivores.

The future of coral reefs depends on acting decisively and protecting them from growing threats, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, establishing marine protected areas, and reducing pollution. Coral restoration and heat-resistant coral strains are also being explored.
