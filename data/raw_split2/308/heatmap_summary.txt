The world has observed a rapid and unexplained decline in honeybee populations, referred to as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), characterized by the sudden disappearance of worker bees from a hive, leaving behind the queen and a small number of nurse bees. Honeybees play a crucial role in pollinating crops and plants, contributing to global food security and biodiversity. Worker bees are responsible for foraging, hive maintenance, and brood care, while the queen lays eggs.

The cause of CCD is debated, with factors like neonicotinoid pesticides, which impair bees' navigation, and parasitic Varroa mites weakening bees and transmitting viruses. Habitat loss, climate change affecting flowering times, and extreme weather also contribute to honeybee decline. Addressing this decline involves reducing pesticide use, controlling mites, restoring habitats, and promoting sustainable beekeeping. Honeybees are essential pollinators for crops and maintaining biodiversity and supporting ecosystems. Artificial Intelligence has found many applications and evolved to an integral part of modern life. At its core, AI refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.
