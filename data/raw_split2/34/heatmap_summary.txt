Amphibians, encompassing frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, face significant threats as one of the most endangered vertebrate groups. Their decline occurs at a rate exceeding that of other vertebrates, raising concerns about ecosystem health and environmental changes. The primary driver of this decline is habitat loss and fragmentation because their complex life cycles require both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The conversion of wetlands, forests, and grasslands into agricultural, urban, and industrial areas has drastically reduced habitat. Fragmentation isolates populations and reduces gene flow, increasing extinction risk. Amphibians play important roles in ecosystems as predators and prey, controlling insect populations and serving as food. The loss of amphibians can disrupt ecological processes and affect other species. Conservation efforts include habitat restoration, disease management, and pollution control, requiring coordinated global action. The introduction of non-native species and competitors can decimate amphibian populations.
