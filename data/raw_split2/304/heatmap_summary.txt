Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various aspects of life, from shopping to medical diagnoses. It centers on creating computer systems capable of tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. Early AI attempts included exploring machine thinking, but progress was initially slow due to computing limitations. Early programs focused on tasks like chess, showcasing potential but not matching human intelligence. A significant development was machine learning, allowing computers to learn from data without explicit programming, identifying patterns for predictions and decisions. Deep learning, using neural networks, is a prominent example. AI is now used across healthcare for analyzing images, diagnosing diseases, and personalizing treatments, and in finance for fraud detection and risk management. In manufacturing, AI automates tasks and enhances efficiency. The automotive industry is utilizing AI in self-driving cars. The advent of digital distribution has drastically changed the music world, enabling easy sharing and downloading via MP3s, and services like Spotify and Apple Music offer vast music libraries. Artificial intelligence is being used to assist in music production.
