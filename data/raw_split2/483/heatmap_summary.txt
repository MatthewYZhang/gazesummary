Bird migration, a phenomenon that has fascinated observers for centuries, involves mass movements over thousands of miles. Resource availability is a primary driver, with birds seeking regions where food is plentiful as seasons change. Birds navigate using innate abilities and learned behaviors, relying on cues such as the Earth's magnetic field, the sun, stars, and polarized light, often learning routes from experienced adults.

Migration demands physiological adaptations, including significant weight gain for energy reserves and increased efficiency in oxygen uptake, along with mechanisms to suppress sleep for continuous flight. Despite these, it remains a dangerous undertaking, with threats such as habitat loss and collisions. Climate change is also altering migration patterns. GPS trackers and other technologies help reveal details about migration routes and stopover sites. Conservation efforts aimed at identifying key migration routes and mitigating threats are crucial to ensuring the survival of migratory birds.
