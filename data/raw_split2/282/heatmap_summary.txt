Between 10,000 and 2,000 BCE, agriculture emerged, transforming human societies and laying the groundwork for civilizations. Agriculture's origins are multifaceted, with independent development in various regions. The earliest evidence is from the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 BCE, where wheat and barley were domesticated with animals. Maize and beans were domesticated in Mesoamerica around 7,000 BCE.

The "Oasis Theory" suggests climate change played a crucial role, with humans and animals congregating around oases, leading to plant and animal domestication as humans managed resources. The "Demographic Stress Model" suggests population growth strained wild food resources, prompting cultivation. The "Social Competition Hypothesis" proposes agriculture generated surplus food to support larger populations and create hierarchies. Agriculture gave control over food production which fueled its spread.

Agriculture had drawbacks such as crop failure and nutritional deficiencies. It required hard work and a sedentary lifestyle. Still, agriculture provided a more reliable food supply, allowing for larger populations, permanent settlements, specialized labor, and social stratification. Today, understanding agriculture's origins and its development is crucial for understanding and addressing current environmental impacts and ensuring future human survival.
