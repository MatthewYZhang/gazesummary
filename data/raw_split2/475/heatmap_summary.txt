The American chestnut was a keystone species in eastern North American forests, towering over other trees and comprising up to 25% of forest composition. Its wood was prized, and its nutritious nuts were a staple food, playing a significant role in the region's ecology, economy, and culture. Native Americans and early European settlers extensively utilized the chestnut. However, in the late 1800s, an Asian chestnut species carrying the chestnut blight was introduced to North America. The blight spread rapidly, infecting and killing trees.

The fungal pathogen enters the tree through wounds in the bark, girdling the trunk and cutting off the flow of nutrients and water. The tree dies, but the root system often survives. Efforts to restore the American chestnut have been ongoing. Scientists are exploring hybridization with blight-resistant Asian chestnut species and genetic engineering to introduce resistance genes. Hybridization aims to combine the desirable traits of the American chestnut with the blight resistance of the Asian chestnut. Genetic engineering techniques insert genes to confer blight resistance directly into the American chestnut genome. The story serves as a cautionary tale about introducing non-native species and preserving biodiversity.
