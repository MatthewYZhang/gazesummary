Our comprehension of the universe stems from observing light emitted by stars and galaxies. However, only a small fraction of the total mass-energy content is directly observable, leading to the concepts of "dark matter" and "dark energy." Evidence for dark matter emerged from galaxy rotation curves. Contrary to expectations based on the laws of physics, stars at the edge of galaxies move faster than predicted, indicating unseen mass contributing gravitational pull. This unseen mass, known as dark matter, doesn't interact with light, rendering it invisible to telescopes. Further evidence comes from gravitational lensing where light from distant galaxies bends around massive objects.

The nature of dark matter and dark energy continues to be a major mystery in physics. Some theories suggest dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), axions, or massive compact halo objects (MACHOs). Dark energy, even more mysterious, is popularly explained by the cosmological constant, yet its observed value is much lower than predicted. Attempts to detect dark matter directly are underway, while astronomers map its distribution. Research into dark energy is focused on measuring the expansion rate of the universe.
