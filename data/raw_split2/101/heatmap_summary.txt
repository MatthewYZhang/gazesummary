Cahokia, near St. Louis, Missouri, was the largest urban center of the Mississippian culture, flourishing from about 800 to 1600 CE. Around 1100 CE, its population rivaled European cities, offering insights into pre-Columbian North America's social, political, and economic organization. The site's massive earthen mounds, over 120 of which once stood, are striking. They vary in size and shape, serving as residences, temples, burials, or ceremonial platforms. Monks Mound is a colossal structure, larger than the Great Pyramid of Giza's base. These mounds required enormous labor and sophisticated engineering, indicating a highly organized society. Cahokia was a planned city with residential, ceremonial, and agricultural zones. The Mississippian culture relied on maize agriculture, supplemented by other crops, and developed sophisticated agricultural techniques. The decline of Cahokia remains debated, with theories including social unrest, environmental degradation, overpopulation, intensive agriculture, and climate change. The city was largely abandoned by 1400 CE, marking the end of an era in North American history.
