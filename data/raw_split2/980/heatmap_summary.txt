The Columbian Exchange, named after Christopher Columbus, refers to the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, diseases, and ideas between the Americas, West Africa, and the Old World. The exchange had profound and lasting impacts on the ecology, agriculture, and culture of both hemispheres.

Before Columbus's voyages, the Americas were largely isolated from the Old World, resulting in distinct ecosystems and agricultural practices. The exchange brought about a radical shift, introducing new crops and livestock to both sides of the Atlantic. From the Americas, crops like potatoes, tomatoes, maize (corn), and beans were introduced to Europe, Asia, and Africa. These crops had a transformative effect on diets.

The Columbian Exchange also involved the transfer of human populations, primarily through the transatlantic slave trade. Millions of Africans were forcibly transported to the Americas.

Europeans brought diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza to the Americas, which led to widespread epidemics and massive population declines. The exchange also facilitated the transfer of technology and ideas. The Columbian Exchange had both positive and negative consequences, shaping the world today.
