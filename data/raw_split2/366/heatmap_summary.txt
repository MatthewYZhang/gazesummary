Cahokia, located near Collinsville, Illinois, flourished from approximately 1050 to 1350 CE and became the largest, most influential urban center of the Mississippian culture. The city's emergence is attributed to agricultural innovations, particularly intensive maize cultivation in the fertile Mississippi River floodplain. Sophisticated techniques and crop diversification enabled a surplus that allowed population specialization. This chiefdom had a hereditary elite organizing construction, notably monumental earthworks like Monks Mound, which served as platforms for temples and residences. Cahokia was a trade center for copper, shells, and stones across a vast network.

The population density caused strain on resources, with deforestation and overhunting possibly leading to environmental issues. The city faced internal conflicts, external threats, and experienced periods of social unrest and violence. Scholars suggest climate change and conflicts with neighboring groups may have contributed to Cahokia's collapse around 1350 CE. Despite debated reasons, a mix of environmental pressures, social tensions, and climatic events likely weakened Cahokia. The abandonment was gradual, resulting in the dispersal of the population and the weakening of centralized power.
