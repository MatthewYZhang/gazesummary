Amphibians, including frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, face a global crisis with a high extinction rate, exceeding historical norms. Their permeable skin and dependence on aquatic and terrestrial habitats make them vulnerable to environmental changes. The current extinction rate is hundreds to thousands of times higher than the background rate, causing severe consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems. Several factors contribute to this decline.

One major driver of amphibian decline is habitat loss and fragmentation, caused by clearing forests for agriculture, urbanization, and resource extraction. Chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungus *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd), also threatens amphibians by infecting their skin and disrupting their ability to regulate water and electrolyte balance. Climate change exacerbates the threats through temperature and rainfall changes, as do pollution and invasive species.

Recognizing the crisis, conservation efforts include habitat restoration, captive breeding programs, disease management strategies, and trade regulation. A promising approach involves probiotics to protect amphibians from Bd infection by competing with the fungus. Another conservation strategy is community engagement. Addressing the crisis requires a joint effort to protect amphibians, whose fate is intertwined with our own.
