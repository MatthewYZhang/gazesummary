Humanism emerged during the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance in Europe, marking a profound shift from the religious focus of the Middle Ages to a renewed interest in classical antiquity, human potential, and earthly life. Medieval thought, influenced by the Church, had emphasized human insignificance before God, with education geared toward religious texts and clergy preparation. Humanism challenged this worldview by emphasizing classical Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and art. Humanists thought that by studying the "humanities"—grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy—individuals could cultivate virtue, wisdom, and eloquence.

One key figure, Francesco Petrarch, championed "studia humanitatis" and celebrated human emotions and accomplishments. The rediscovery of classical texts was aided by the fall of Constantinople in 1453, with Byzantine scholars bringing Greek manuscripts to Italy, fueling the humanist movement. Humanism profoundly influenced Renaissance art, with artists depicting the human form with greater realism and exploring human themes. New schools emphasized classical languages and history. Humanism challenged religious dogma, celebrated human potential, and emphasized education and civic engagement. The printing press also aided the spread of humanist ideals. Ultimately, humanist scholars drew political inspiration from ancient Greece and Rome, advocating for limited government, the rule of law, and civic virtue.
