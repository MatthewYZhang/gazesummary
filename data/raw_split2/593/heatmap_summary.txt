Ecotourism, intended to minimize environmental impact and support local communities, faces challenges regarding its actual impact on fragile ecosystems. It generates revenue for local communities and encourages conservation through job creation, support for local businesses, and funding for conservation projects, incentivizing the preservation of natural resources by showing the economic benefits of healthy ecosystems, which reduces the pressure to exploit resources through logging or mining.

The physical presence of tourists can disrupt habitats, damage vegetation, and compact soil. Infrastructure construction disrupts wildlife migration patterns. Introducing non-native species poses risks to local biodiversity. Disturbances to wildlife, prioritizing profit over animal welfare, feeding animals, approaching too closely, and using flash photography can harm animals. Ecotourism's effectiveness requires strict regulations, funding, staffing, careful planning, and waste management. Also, local communities must participate in decision-making and management to address their needs and ensure environmental stewardship. Careful planning, strict regulation, and community involvement are essential for ensuring that ecotourism truly benefits both people and the planet.
