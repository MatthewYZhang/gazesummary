The Cambrian Explosion refers to the dramatic diversification of life on Earth approximately 541 million years ago, with most major animal phyla appearing in the fossil record. Before this period, life was primarily microbial, dominated by simple, soft-bodied organisms. Fossils from the Ediacaran period show early multicellular organisms, but these forms generally lacked the complex body plans and hard skeletons that characterize Cambrian animals. One hypothesis suggests that rising oxygen levels allowed for the evolution of larger, more active animals, while another proposes that hard body parts provided protection and allowed for the development of new ecological niches. The evolution of eyes may have also played a role. This event marked a turning point in the history of life, as animals diversified into a wide range of forms. It had a profound impact on marine ecosystems, leading to more complex food webs. The Cambrian Explosion remains one of the most important events in the history of life, marking a fundamental shift in the organization of life on Earth.
