The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, endured for a thousand years after the Western Roman Empire crumbled in the 5th century. It preserved Roman law, culture, and the Greek language before falling to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.

The foundation of the empire was laid by Constantine the Great, who moved the Roman capital to Byzantium in 330 AD, renaming it Constantinople, which had defensive advantages and controlled crucial trade routes. Constantine's adoption of Christianity profoundly shaped Byzantine culture and identity. 

The Fourth Crusade delivered a devastating blow when Crusaders sacked Constantinople in 1204. The Byzantines regained control in 1261, but the Empire never recovered.  Constantinople fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453, marking the end of the Byzantine Empire. The Empire's military was known for its discipline and tactics but was gradually weakened by internal strife and economic woes.

The Byzantine economy was robust and diversified, based on agriculture, trade, and industry.  The Empire controlled key trade routes connecting East and West. The Byzantine monetary system, with its stable gold coinage ("bezant"), served as an international standard for centuries. Byzantium was an ancient Greek city on the site of modern Istanbul, and the Ottoman Turks were a Turkish dynasty that conquered Constantinople.
