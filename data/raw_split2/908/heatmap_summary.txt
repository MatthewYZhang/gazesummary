The rise of coffee culture, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the U.S. and Europe, marked a shift from a simple beverage to a complex cultural phenomenon. The introduction of specialty coffee chains like Starbucks significantly altered consumption patterns by offering a wide variety of coffee drinks and cultivating an ambiance conducive to socializing. This period also witnessed growing consumer interest in ethically sourced, high-quality coffee beans, leading to the popularity of fair trade practices and single-origin coffees. Artisanal roasters further contributed by focusing on small-batch techniques that enhance the flavor profiles of diverse beans, elevating coffee to a specialty item. Coffee shops became essential as "third places" to socialize, relax, and work remotely, filling a void created by changing urban dynamics, and their role was further solidified by the availability of Wi-Fi. Additionally, Italian espresso culture shaped the modern coffee experience by emphasizing precise brewing methods. While facing criticism regarding environmental impacts and exploitation, coffee culture's impact is undeniable, and it continues to evolve.
