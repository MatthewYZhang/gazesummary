Invasive species, which are introduced organisms outside their natural habitat, can have substantial effects on native ecosystems and economies. The introduction can be accidental or intentional. While not all introduced species become invasive, those that do can outcompete native species for resources such as food, water, and habitat, leading to population declines or even local extinctions. Invasive species often lack natural predators, allowing their populations to grow unchecked. They can also alter the physical structure of an ecosystem, introduce new diseases or parasites, and cause significant economic losses. For example, the zebra mussel has drastically altered the Great Lakes ecosystem, and the emerald ash borer has caused widespread damage to ash trees.

Managing invasive species can be complex, and prevention is often the most cost-effective approach. Early detection and rapid response are also crucial. Control methods can vary, including biological, chemical, and physical control.

In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin. Penicillin's impact on human health has been profound, revolutionizing the treatment of bacterial infections and saving countless lives. Fleming discovered that a mold had contaminated a petri dish containing Staphylococcus bacteria, and around the mold, there was a clear zone where the bacteria had been killed. In the late 1930s, Florey and Chain took up the challenge of isolating and purifying penicillin.

However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, posing a serious threat to public health.
