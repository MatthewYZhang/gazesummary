The development of the printing press in Europe marked a revolutionary shift in the dissemination of knowledge following the High Middle Ages. Before this innovation, books were painstakingly copied by hand by monks and scribes, making them rare and expensive, accessible only to the elite. The growing demand for books, spurred by universities and a burgeoning literate class, highlighted the limitations of manuscript production. 

Johannes Gutenberg's innovations in the 15th century were pivotal. He introduced movable type, individual metal characters that could be assembled, inked, and pressed onto paper, which allowed for rapid and relatively inexpensive text reproduction. He also developed an oil-based ink and a modified screw press, significantly reducing the time and cost of book production. His first major work was the Bible around 1455. Other printers soon adopted Gutenberg's methods, establishing presses in major European cities, producing religious texts, classical literature, and more.

The increased availability of books fueled literacy and accelerated the spread of knowledge and ideas. The printing press also had a significant impact on the economy, creating new jobs and stimulating industries like papermaking and ink production. Despite facing resistance and censorship from the Church, the printing press continued to flourish, revolutionizing the production and dissemination of knowledge.
