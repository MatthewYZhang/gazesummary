The Indus Valley Civilization, also known as the Harappan Civilization, flourished from around 3300 to 1700 BCE, ranking as one of the earliest urban societies in the world, contemporary with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. This civilization remains shrouded in mystery due to its undeciphered script, which makes it challenging to understand social structures, political organization, and beliefs.

The civilization's geographical reach spanned over a million square kilometers, larger than Egypt and Mesopotamia. Key urban centers, Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, were characterized by advanced urban planning. Cities had a grid pattern with well-organized streets, drainage systems, and standardized baked-brick buildings, including a citadel and lower town.

Homes were connected to covered drains that emptied into sewers beneath the main streets, providing clean water and removing waste efficiently. Public baths indicate a focus on communal bathing and perhaps ritual purification.

The economy was based on agriculture and trade. The fertile lands of the Indus River Valley allowed for crop cultivation, supporting a large population and facilitating trade. Extensive trade networks with Mesopotamia, Central Asia, and the Persian Gulf are evidenced by Indus seals and artifacts.

Around 1900 BCE, the Indus Valley Civilization began to decline. The causes of this decline are still debated. Climate change and overexploitation of resources may have contributed to the decline. The decline led to the abandonment of major urban centers and a shift to smaller settlements. Some scholars believe that the Indo-Aryan migrations may have contributed to the decline.
