Artificial light at night (ALAN), or light pollution, is the excessive use of outdoor artificial light and is recognized as a significant environmental stressor. Artificial light disrupts fundamental biological processes that rely on predictable day-night cycles. ALAN significantly impacts animal behavior, disorienting nocturnal animals like moths, bats, and birds, leading them to stray, collide with structures, or impair hunting. For example, sea turtle hatchlings become attracted to artificial lights, moving inland and increasing their risk of death. Migratory birds using celestial cues can become disoriented by artificial lights, deviating from their migratory paths. Aquatic ecosystems are also vulnerable, with light pollution penetrating water surfaces and affecting aquatic organisms. Phytoplankton, crucial for aquatic food webs, faces disruption of photosynthesis cycles. Fish species experience disrupted migration and reproduction behaviors, leading to spawning decline. Efforts to mitigate ALAN include shielded light fixtures, reduced light intensity, and warmer color temperatures. Widespread adoption requires greater public awareness and collective effort.
