Mapping technologies have evolved from cave sketches to satellite systems, influencing navigation, trade, and even our understanding of space. Early maps used sticks, stones, shells, and strings to depict routes and resources, yet lacked standardization and accuracy. Ancient civilizations made significant advancements with the Greeks laying the foundation for scientific mapmaking, and the Age of Exploration saw increased mapmaking activity, aided by the printing press and Mercator projection. Later centuries brought refinements in surveying and the development of thematic mapping. The 20th and 21st centuries saw a technological revolution in mapping with aerial photography, satellite imagery, and GIS.

The discovery of iron marked a key moment in human history. Although copper and bronze were used before, iron was stronger and more available, which boosted toolmaking, agriculture, and weaponry. The Hittites first used iron in Anatolia around the third millennium BCE, but it became more common after their empire fell. Iron tools enhanced farming and warfare, leading to new empires.

Plants protect themselves from herbivores with defenses ranging from physical barriers and chemical deterrents to indirect strategies. The most common is physical barriers like bark and thorns. Plants also have toxic or digestibility-reducing chemical compounds. Indirect defenses include providing food or shelter for beneficial insects that act as bodyguards. The release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can attract natural enemies of the herbivores, or warn neighboring plants to activate their own defenses.
