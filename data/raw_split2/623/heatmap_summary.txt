Mycorrhizae, a crucial symbiotic relationship between fungi and plant roots, plays a vital role in the health and function of terrestrial ecosystems. This mutualistic association involves a reciprocal exchange of resources, where the fungus increases the surface area for nutrient and water absorption, and the plant provides carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis. This exchange is especially important for uptake of phosphorus and nitrogen, which are essential nutrients.

There are two primary types of mycorrhizae: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form a sheath around the root tip and extend hyphae between root cells, commonly found in forests with coniferous and deciduous trees. Endomycorrhizae penetrate the plant root cells, forming specialized structures called arbuscules, which are the sites of nutrient exchange. These are far more widespread.

Human activities, such as agriculture and deforestation, can significantly impact mycorrhizal communities, through the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Practices that promote mycorrhizal colonization enhance plant productivity and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Further research is essential for understanding the complex interactions between mycorrhizal fungi, plants, and the environment, and for preserving and restoring mycorrhizal communities for long-term ecosystem health.
