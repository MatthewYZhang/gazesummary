The Maya civilization flourished from approximately 2000 BCE to 1697 CE, encompassing southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. Unlike centralized empires, the Maya were organized into independent city-states with their own rulers and nobility, linked by trade, alliances, and shared cultural practices.

The Classic Period (250-900 CE) marked the zenith of Maya civilization, showcasing monumental architecture like pyramids, palaces, and intricate observatories. City-states like Tikal, Palenque, and Cop√°n vied for dominance through warfare and diplomatic maneuvering. The Maya calendar system, including the meticulous observation of celestial movements, allowed Maya astronomers to predict eclipses and astronomical events.

Agriculture was the foundation of Maya life, with maize being the staple crop. The Maya developed sophisticated agricultural techniques, including terracing, irrigation, and raised fields. The Maya calendar system comprised a complex interplay of different cycles and was arguably the most sophisticated timekeeping system of the ancient world. Rituals and ceremonies played a central role in Maya life, aimed at appeasing the gods and ensuring the prosperity of the community.

The Spanish conquest brought an end to Maya political independence, but Maya culture and traditions have survived to the present day. Millions of Maya people still live in their ancestral lands, speaking Maya languages and preserving aspects of their rich cultural heritage. The reasons for the Maya collapse are complex and multifaceted, and remain a subject of debate among scholars.
