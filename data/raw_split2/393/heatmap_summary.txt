Bird migration is the seasonal movement of birds between breeding and non-breeding areas, driven by the search for food and optimal breeding conditions. Birds employ various migration strategies, including long journeys like the Arctic Tern and shorter migrations of warblers.

Navigating long distances requires remarkable feats of orientation, relying on the Earth's magnetic field, the sun and stars, polarized light, and an innate sense of direction. Young birds learn migration routes from experienced individuals. Birds face challenges during their journeys such as starvation, exhaustion, predation, and human-made obstacles. Climate change is also impacting migration patterns, with some species shortening migration distances and others arriving earlier at breeding grounds.

Bird migration research involves bird banding, radio telemetry, and satellite tracking. The Columbian Exchange refers to the transfer of plants, animals, and ideas between the Americas and the Old World, with positive and devastating consequences such as the transatlantic slave trade and the spread of diseases.
