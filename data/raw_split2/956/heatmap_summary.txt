The Maya civilization, flourishing in Mesoamerica, developed a complex society with mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. The civilization is characterized by sophisticated mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. The Classic Period represented the zenith of the Maya civilization, featuring prominent city-states like Tikal and Palenque. Maya society was highly stratified, with an elite, priests, warriors, artisans, and farmers. They used a hieroglyphic writing system to record history and astronomical observations. The Maya astronomers made accurate calculations of the solar year and lunar cycles, and their mathematical system included the concept of zero. However, around the 9th century AD, a dramatic decline occurred, known as the Classic Maya Collapse. The causes of this decline continue to be debated by scholars. A prominent theory suggests that unsustainable agricultural practices led to soil erosion and famine. Despite the collapse, Maya culture persisted in the Yucatan Peninsula and highlands, but the arrival of the Spanish led to conquest. Today, the Maya people preserve their culture.
