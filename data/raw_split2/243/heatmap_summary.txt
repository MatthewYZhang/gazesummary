Coastal dunes, dynamic landforms shaped by wind, sand, and vegetation along coastlines, are important for protecting against erosion and storm surges, acting as sand reservoirs, and supporting ecosystems. Their formation involves sand accumulation on the backshore between the high tide line and vegetation, transported by wind from the beach face and deposited by waves. Obstacles like driftwood and small plants trap sand, initiating small hummocks that provide shelter for vegetation.

Sea level changes significantly impact dune formation. Rising sea levels erode or submerge dunes, while falling levels expose new areas for dune formation. The ability of dunes to adapt depends on the rate of sea level change, sediment supply, and protective structures. Effective dune management is crucial for protecting communities and preserving ecological integrity. Management includes dune restoration, beach nourishment, and regulations on development, balancing human needs with resource protection. Understanding dune processes is key to sustainable management and ecosystem resilience.
