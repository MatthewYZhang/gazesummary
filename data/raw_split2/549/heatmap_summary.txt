Cahokia, a significant Mississippian culture metropolis near Collinsville, Illinois, flourished from approximately 1050 to 1350 CE. It grew due to intensive maize agriculture and a well-organized society. Farmers utilized methods such as crop rotation and terracing, transforming the landscape to sustain their population. It once housed between 10,000 and 20,000 people. The city was characterized by its agricultural practices and mound construction. Its meticulously planned layout included earthen mounds of varying sizes and purposes, with Monks Mound being the most prominent. Cahokia's decline began around the 13th century, with debates among archaeologists regarding its causes, including environmental degradation from agriculture. The city's eventual abandonment may be attributed to a combination of environmental factors, social and political instability due to rigid social hierarchies, and climate change. Prolonged droughts during the 13th and 14th centuries exacerbated these problems, eventually leading to its abandonment.
