The assembly line, a revolutionary manufacturing process, has profoundly shaped industrial production since its inception. Understanding its evolution and impact requires examining its historical context, technological advancements, and societal consequences. Its groundwork was laid in the 18th and 19th centuries with Oliver Evans' continuous flour mill and Eli Whitney's use of interchangeable parts.

Henry Ford's contribution involved applying core principles in a novel and efficient manner to automobile production, reducing the assembly time of a Model T from over 12 hours to approximately 90 minutes. The assembly line became a model for mass production in various sectors, increasing efficiency and reducing production costs. The division of labor, combined with the constant movement of the product, dramatically increased efficiency and reduced production costs. The time required to assemble a Model T dropped from over 12 hours to approximately 90 minutes, making cars more affordable and fueling mass consumption. Despite its drawbacks, the assembly line remains a fundamental principle of modern manufacturing.
