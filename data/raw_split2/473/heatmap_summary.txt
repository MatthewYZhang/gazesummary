The evolution of musical notation arose from the desire to preserve and transmit music. Early forms of notation acted as mnemonic devices. Cuneiform texts from Mesopotamia (circa 2000 BCE) contain instructions for performance, including tuning and rhythmic patterns, yet they do not provide a detailed representation of melodies and may have served as a guide for trained musicians already familiar with the repertoire. Ancient Greece contributed two distinct systems, one for instrumental music using symbols derived from an archaic alphabet, and another for vocal music employing modified letters to indicate intervals. A significant advancement occurred during the medieval period in Europe. Monks in monasteries developed neumes, originally simple symbols indicating melodic contour in Gregorian chants. While early notation systems may appear limited by modern standards, they laid the essential groundwork for the sophisticated notation used by composers today.
