Collective memory, a shared knowledge pool held by a social group, shapes identity, behavior, and cultural transmission. Itâ€™s a constructed narrative, constantly negotiated and renegotiated influencing our understanding of the past, perception of the present, and future vision. Unlike personal memories based on direct experience, collective memory is mediated through cultural products like books and monuments. These artifacts provide a common reference point, and rituals like national holidays reinforce national identity and collective purpose.

Historical events are not always remembered in their entirety and selective remembering is influenced by dominant ideologies. This shaping process can lead to controversies, especially as narratives are constantly negotiated. Collective memory is not static, with new interpretations emerging and the rise of social media complicating this process. The influence of collective memory is not without challenges, and its manipulation can have devastating consequences. Critically examining the construction and transmission of collective memory can help us understand human societies and work towards building a more inclusive and just world.
