Around 1050 A.D., Cahokia emerged near present-day St. Louis, Missouri, becoming the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico and a center of Mississippian culture. It thrived for centuries, but by the 14th century, it was mysteriously abandoned. Cahokia's rise was closely tied to agricultural innovation, specifically the adoption of a productive maize variety that allowed for surplus food production and a larger, more concentrated population. This surplus also drove specialized labor and hierarchical social structures. Archaeological evidence suggests Cahokia was governed by a powerful elite class controlling resources, labor, and religious ceremonies, as demonstrated by the scale of construction. However, despite its achievements, Cahokia declined in the 13th century due to environmental degradation from intensive agriculture, social and political instability and possible climate change. By the 14th century, Cahokia was largely deserted. Its story offers insight into pre-Columbian societies and the challenges they faced.
