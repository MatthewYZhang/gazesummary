Cahokia, a Mississippian metropolis, emerged as a remarkable expression of societal transformation around 800 CE to 1600 CE, evolving from semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer groups into a complex agricultural society due to shifts in climate and resources in the Mississippi River Valley. Archaeological evidence from meticulously excavated mounds paints a picture of a vibrant society, with a shift towards intensive maize agriculture supplemented by squash, beans, and native plants, which facilitated population growth and social hierarchies. Cahokians were skilled artisans who crafted intricate copper ornaments, shell beads, and finely worked flint tools.

Trade networks extended throughout the Mississippi River Valley, bringing raw materials like copper and marine shells to Cahokia. Careful analysis of burial sites reveals that some individuals were buried with elaborate grave goods, while others had little ornamentation. Archaeological evidence also suggests the practice of human sacrifice, possibly associated with the death of a ruler, and the discovery of a mass grave containing the remains of young women. The reasons for Cahokia's decline are complex and still debated among archaeologists, but it eventually met its end.
