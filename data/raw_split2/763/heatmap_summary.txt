Fairy circles are peculiar phenomena found in arid grasslands, characterized by circular patches of bare soil surrounded by a ring of denser grass. Scientists have proposed various explanations for these mysterious formations. One early hypothesis suggests that termites systematically consume the roots of grasses within the circle, leading to the bare patch and redirecting resources towards the perimeter. However, critics point out that the distribution of fairy circles doesn't always correlate with termite presence.

Another explanation involves plant competition for water. In water-scarce regions, plants create depletion zones around themselves, leading to a mosaic of areas where water is scarce and resulting in fairy circle structures. However, the sharply defined edges of the circles and the uniform size distribution are not always consistent with purely competitive dynamics.

More recently, an integrated approach suggests a combination of factors, including termites, plant competition, and environmental factors. In this scenario, termites initiate the bare patch, altering water balance and nutrient distribution.

Animals exhibit extraordinary navigation abilities, using cues like the Earth's magnetic field, the sun, and landmarks. Some animals sense the direction and intensity of the magnetic field through specialized cells. During the day, other animals use the sun as a celestial reference point, maintaining a consistent heading over long distances. The hippocampus plays a critical role in processing navigational information. Future research will be essential for unraveling the remaining mysteries of animal navigation.
