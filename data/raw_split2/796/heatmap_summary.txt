The ability to fly has emerged independently across diverse animal groups, but the most well-studied are birds. One hypothesis suggests flight evolved in arboreal ancestors, who initially used forelimbs for gliding. Over time, selection favored individuals with larger feathers and more efficient wing shapes. The development of powered flight allowed them to exploit new resources and escape predators. An alternative theory proposes flight arose from terrestrial ancestors, using forelimbs for catching insects, maintaining balance, or social displays.

Regardless of the pathway, flight required morphological adaptations, most notably feathers for lift and thrust, which are remarkably lightweight and allow for airflow control. Birds have also evolved skeletal and muscular adaptations crucial for flight, including hollow bones, a keeled sternum for flight muscle attachment, and an efficient respiratory system. Some birds, like eagles, are soaring masters, while hummingbirds can hover. The evolution of flight is a complex story, requiring morphological and behavioral adaptations and is a testament to natural selection.
