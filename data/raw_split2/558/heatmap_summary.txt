Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate structures, providing habitat for a quarter of marine life, and are predominantly in tropical waters. They are ecologically significant, providing shelter, feeding grounds, breeding sites, and nurseries for marine species. Coral reefs are integral to the food web and provide refuge from predators and help the flourish of smaller creatures. Sponges and algae contribute to the ecosystem's health through filtration and nutrient cycling.

They also provide crucial services to human populations by acting as natural coastal barriers, protecting shorelines from erosion and storm surges, which is particularly vital for island nations and coastal communities vulnerable to sea-level rise and increased storm intensity.

However, coral reefs are facing unprecedented threats due to human activities and climate change, rising ocean temperatures are causing coral bleaching, where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, leading to starvation and eventual death if the stress persists. Addressing the root causes of their decline and implementing effective conservation strategies can ensure these ecosystems thrive and provide benefits for generations.
