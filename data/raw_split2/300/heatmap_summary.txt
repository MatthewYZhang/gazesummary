Before European contact, North America was home to diverse indigenous cultures, including the Mississippian culture, which flourished in the Mississippi River Valley. Cahokia, located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois, was the largest and most influential city of this culture. Cahokia emerged around 1050 CE, experiencing rapid growth. Its population is estimated to have reached between 10,000 and 20,000 at its peak, making it one of the largest cities in the world at the time.

The sheer scale of Cahokia's construction projects indicates advanced social organization and technological capabilities. The most prominent feature of the city is Monks Mound, a massive earthen pyramid covering 14 acres and rising to 100 feet. This colossal structure is the largest prehistoric earthen mound in North America and required immense labor and resources. By the 14th century, Cahokia had been largely abandoned. The cityâ€™s impressive mounds and artifacts provide valuable insights into the complex societies and cultural achievements of pre-Columbian North America.
