Phantom limbs, the perplexing sensation of feeling a limb that's absent, have puzzled scientists, leading to various theories explaining the continued sensory perceptions, including pain. One early explanation, now discredited, suggested irritation of nerve endings mimicking sensations, but it fails to account for persistent pain and diverse sensations like warmth, itching, tingling, or feeling jewelry. A more compelling theory focuses on the brain's reorganization, where the somatosensory cortex remapping may cause stimulation of the face to trigger sensations in the phantom hand. This cortical remapping doesn't fully explain phantom limb pain and the brain's expectation of sensory feedback, which causes discrepancy. The "neuromatrix theory" says the brain generates a sense of body self, which is no longer grounded in reality, leading to the experience of phantom sensations. Furthermore, visual input from techniques like mirror therapy can recalibrate the brain. In summary, the puzzle of phantom limbs involves a complex interplay of factors, including cortical reorganization, sensory mismatch, the brain's internal representation of the body, and visual feedback.
