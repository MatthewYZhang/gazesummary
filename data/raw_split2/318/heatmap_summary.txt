The pervasiveness of artificial light at night (ALAN) disrupts ecosystems, causing problems for nocturnal wildlife. Specifically, ALAN disrupts animals' natural behaviors, physiology, and survival, particularly impacting their natural ability to navigate for foraging and reproduction. Artificial lights disorient these animals, leading them astray into dangerous situations; for example, moths are attracted to streetlights and sea turtle hatchlings are drawn inland. ALAN also disrupts predator-prey relationships, affecting melatonin production, which is critical for sleep cycles, immune function, and antioxidant activity. To address these problems, the article calls for responsible lighting practices, like reducing the intensity of artificial lights, using shielded fixtures, and employing light sources with warmer color temperatures. Addressing light pollution and implementing mitigation measures can help preserve natural rhythms, create sustainable environments, and protect the species that rely on these rhythms.
