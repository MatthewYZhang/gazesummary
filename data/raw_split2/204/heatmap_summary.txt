E-commerce, also known as electronic commerce, has significantly changed how businesses operate and how consumers shop, involving the buying and selling of goods and services over the internet. Though online shopping started in the 1970s, it truly took off with the spread of the internet in the 1990s, becoming a global phenomenon with trillions of dollars in yearly transactions. Several factors, including accessibility and affordability of the internet, technological advancements like secure payment gateways and improved logistics, and the advantages it offers to both businesses and consumers, contributed to its growth.

E-commerce includes Business-to-consumer (B2C), Business-to-business (B2B), Consumer-to-consumer (C2C), and Consumer-to-business (C2B) models. Despite its benefits, e-commerce faces challenges, like cybersecurity and complex logistics and businesses must comply with data privacy laws and consumer protection laws. The future of e-commerce will include mobile commerce, social commerce, and artificial intelligence.
