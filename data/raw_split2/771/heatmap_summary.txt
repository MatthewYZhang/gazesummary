For most of human history, knowledge was orally transmitted through spoken word, song, and demonstration, shaping social structures and cultural practices. Memory played a crucial role, and storytelling abilities held respect and influence. The emergence of agriculture and settled communities created conditions that fostered the development of written language due to the growing complexity of societies and the need for efficient record-keeping. The management of resources, trade, and codification of laws demanded a system beyond human memory. Early forms of writing were pictographic, like Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphics, and early Chinese systems. Over time, writing evolved from pictographs to more abstract symbols and eventually to alphabetic systems. Lastly, the impact of written language on human civilization has been profound. It has facilitated communication and fostered the development of complex systems, transforming how we think and learn.
