Coral reefs are diverse ecosystems, formed by coral polyps secreting calcium carbonate skeletons. These structures provide support for marine life, acting as natural barriers, supporting fisheries, and attracting tourism. Coastal protection from erosion and storm surges is another vital ecosystem service that reefs provide, especially for communities where they safeguard homes and agriculture. They also are nurseries for commercially important fish. Reefs support marine life and are economically significant, drawing tourists globally and supporting local economies.

Threats to coral reefs include human activities and climate change, particularly ocean acidification, resulting from excess carbon dioxide absorption, weakening the coral skeletons. Rising sea temperatures also cause coral bleaching, and pollution from land-based sources introduces toxins that harm corals. Overfishing and destructive fishing practices can disrupt reef ecosystems. Reef degradation leads to biodiversity loss and economic impacts, requiring urgent action to protect and restore coral reefs through reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, managing fisheries sustainably, and marine protected areas.
