The Maya civilization, flourishing in Mesoamerica, made sophisticated achievements in mathematics, astronomy, art, and architecture. The reasons for its decline have been the subject of scholarly debate. During the Classic period, the Maya civilization reached its peak with powerful city-states like Tikal, Palenque, and Cop√°n, each ruled by a divine king. These cities featured monumental architecture, like towering pyramids, ornate palaces, and ballcourts. Maya society was highly stratified with distinct social classes. Agriculture, especially maize, was the cornerstone of the Maya economy. The Classic Maya collapse in the southern lowlands between the 8th and 9th centuries AD is a major mystery. Theories suggest environmental factors like droughts, warfare, overpopulation, and economic decline contributed to the collapse, though no single factor was solely responsible. In the Post-Classic period, the Maya continued in the northern Yucatan Peninsula but never regained the integration of the Classic period. The arrival of the Spanish marked the end of Maya independence, though Maya culture endures.
