Cahokia, located near St. Louis, Missouri, was the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico, flourishing from 1050 to 1350 CE, showcasing complex social organization and sophisticated engineering. Its decline presents a puzzle for archaeologists, involving climate change, resource depletion, and social unrest. Cahokia's location at the confluence of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Illinois rivers provided access to a vast network of waterways, promoting trade and communication and contributing to its growth.

One theory suggests a prolonged drought around 1300 CE severely impacted agricultural production and may have exacerbated existing tensions. Another theory focuses on resource depletion; intensive timber use led to deforestation and increased transportation costs. The concentration of power among a small elite could have caused resentment and social unrest, as construction of the mounds required significant labor. The exact causes of Cahokia's decline remain debated, but likely involved a combination of climate change, resource depletion, social unrest, and external threats. Cahokia's impressive mounds preserve its legacy, and continued research promises to shed light on its rise and fall.
