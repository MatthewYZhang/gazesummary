Bird migration, a captivating phenomenon, sees billions undertake perilous journeys yearly, navigating to breeding or wintering grounds. Despite research, the mechanisms behind this remain intriguing. Birds navigate using various sophisticated cues instead of maps and compasses. They possess an internal magnetic compass, sensing the Earth's magnetic field to orient themselves, and utilize the sun, moon, and stars as celestial landmarks, adjusting flight paths by time and year. Scent gradients guide them, and visual cues like coastlines provide additional navigation, while the decision to migrate is influenced by environmental factors and physiological changes.

Changes in day length stimulate shifts preparing birds for migration, prompting them to accumulate fat reserves and triggering migratory restlessness. Weather and food play a crucial role, but migrating also presents challenges. Recent tech allows tracking of birds and revealing the remarkable journeys of these avian travelers, however, many mysteries remain. Further research is needed to assess the impact of climate change and protect these species.
