Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism. It occurs across many species, especially in marine environments. It serves various ecological functions, from predator avoidance to mate attraction. The chemical basis involves luciferin and luciferase reacting with oxygen to produce light. The exact chemical structures of luciferin and luciferase vary widely, suggesting multiple independent evolutionary origins.

In the marine environment, bioluminescence is exceptionally prevalent with counterillumination being a key function, where light on an organism's underside matches downwelling sunlight for camouflage. The anglerfish dangles a bioluminescent lure to attract prey, and bioluminescence can be used for communication, as in mating displays and alarm signals, with squid ejecting bioluminescent fluid to confuse predators. On land, fireflies use flashing lights to attract mates. Bioluminescent fungi, called "foxfire," are found in decaying wood. Recent research has explored the potential applications of bioluminescence in fields like biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and biosensors.
