The Mayan civilization, famous for its advanced math, astronomy, and intricate hieroglyphic writing, flourished in modern-day Mexico and Central America for centuries. It experienced a dramatic decline, starting in the 8th century and ending in the abandonment of many major cities by 900 AD. The reasons behind this collapse remain a topic of intense debate.

Several theories attempt to explain the Maya demise, one of which focuses on environmental factors. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Maya population reached unsustainable levels, leading to deforestation, soil erosion, and depletion of natural resources. The Maya relied on agriculture, especially maize cultivation. Intensive farming practices combined with environmental degradation may have led to decreased agricultural productivity, resulting in widespread food shortages and famine. Paleoclimatic studies reveal evidence of severe droughts during the Terminal Classic Period (roughly 800-900 AD). These droughts would have severely impacted agricultural yields. Some researchers argue that these droughts were amplified by the Maya's own deforestation activities, creating a vicious cycle of environmental degradation and societal collapse.
