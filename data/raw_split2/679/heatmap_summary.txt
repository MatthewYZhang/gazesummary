The Fertile Crescent, a region including modern-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and the Levant, is known as the birthplace of agriculture due to its unique environmental conditions and geographical features that enabled the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural communities. This development was a gradual process that spanned several millennia and had a profound impact on human history.

Prior to agriculture, humans relied on hunting and gathering. A significant shift occurred around 10,000 BCE, with the Younger Dryas period possibly forcing more intensive exploitation of wild food sources and the systematic harvesting of grains and the development of techniques to process and store them. The Fertile Crescent was particularly suited for agriculture, possessing a rich diversity of wild cereals, including wheat and barley, and a Mediterranean climate ideal for grain cultivation. The initial stages of agriculture involved cultivating wild cereals. The transition to agriculture also led to increased food surpluses, which allowed for population growth and the specialization of labor and the development of complex social and political structures.
