Color perception is complex and subjective, influenced by physiological responses, learned associations, and cultural contexts. At a fundamental level, color perception begins with the eye's photoreceptor cells: cones and rods. Cones are responsible for color vision and are most active in bright light conditions and are sensitive to red, green, and blue. The brain processes signals from cones to create a spectrum of perceived colors. Rods, on the other hand, are more sensitive to light intensity and are responsible for vision in low-light conditions.

The experience of color transcends mere physiological processes. From a young age, we learn to associate colors with specific emotions, objects, or events. Red is often associated with excitement, passion, or danger, while blue is linked to calmness, tranquility, or sadness. Cultural context plays a significant role in shaping color symbolism. Furthermore, color preferences are influenced by personal factors such as age, gender, and personality. The application of color psychology is prevalent in fields such as marketing, advertising, and design. Ultimately, the psychology of color perception is a dynamic and multifaceted field.
