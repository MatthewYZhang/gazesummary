Cahokia, an influential Mississippian culture urban center located in present-day Illinois, flourished from approximately 800 to 1600 CE. Around 1100 CE, it boasted a population estimated between 10,000 and 20,000. This settlement featured impressive earthen mounds, advanced agricultural practices, and complex social organization. Cahokia's prominence was due to its strategic location in the Mississippi River valley, which enabled intensive maize agriculture and supported a growing population. Advanced farming techniques such as crop rotation and terracing were used to maximize crop yields.

The collection of earthen mounds is the most distinctive feature of Cahokia. These mounds served various purposes, including residences, platforms for temples, and burial sites. The largest structure, Monks Mound, rises over 100 feet and covers 14 acres. The construction of these mounds demonstrated the power and organizational capacity of Cahokia's ruling class. The Cahokian society was highly stratified, with distinctions between the elite and commoners.

Despite its success, Cahokia declined in the 13th and 14th centuries. This decline has been attributed to factors such as environmental degradation, deforestation, soil erosion, and climate change, which undermined agricultural productivity. Violence also increased during the later stages of Cahokia's occupation, suggesting instability and competition for resources. The abandonment of Cahokia remains a subject of debate. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
