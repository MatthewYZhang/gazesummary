Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, playing a vital role in plant nutrition and overall forest dynamics. Most plants, especially trees, form mycorrhizal relationships, wherein the fungus colonizes the plant's roots, extending hyphae into the soil, thus increasing the surface area for nutrient and water absorption. The plant, in return, provides the fungus with carbohydrates from photosynthesis.

The two primary types of mycorrhizae are ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae form a sheath around plant roots and are associated with species like pines and oaks. Endomycorrhizae penetrate directly into root cells, forming arbuscules, and are more widespread. Soil conditions and nutrient availability influence the distribution of mycorrhizae. 

Mycorrhizal associations benefit plants by enhancing nutrient and water uptake and increasing drought tolerance. These fungi protect plants from pathogens and improve soil structure. The presence of diverse mycorrhizal fungi influences plant community composition and forest productivity, particularly in nutrient-poor soils. Agriculture, deforestation, and pollution can disrupt these beneficial associations, and sustainable forestry practices help maintain the health of mycorrhizal fungi. Understanding these relationships is crucial for effective forest management and conservation.
