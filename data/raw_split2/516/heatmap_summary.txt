Fungi are a distinct kingdom that play a crucial role in Earth's ecosystems through nutrient cycling, decomposition, and symbiotic relationships. The vast majority of fungal life exists hidden as mycelium, networks of thread-like hyphae. Fungi exhibit a wide range of lifestyles, including decomposers that break down organic matter and release nutrients into the soil. They are also essential in various industries, such as food production and as a source of antibiotics like penicillin, which revolutionized medicine. Fungi are also being explored for bioremediation. While fungi are essential, they can also pose threats through fungal diseases that devastate crops and cause infections. Mycorrhizae are symbiotic associations between fungi and plant roots, where the fungus enhances the plant's ability to absorb water and nutrients, particularly phosphorus, in return for carbohydrates.
