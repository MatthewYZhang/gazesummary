Rivers are dynamic forces responsible for shaping landscapes through erosion, transportation, and deposition, playing a crucial role in shaping Earth's geological features. Erosion, a primary mechanism, relies on the flowing water's kinetic energy to dislodge and carry away soil, rock, and materials, particularly in areas with steep gradients. Rivers erode through hydraulic action, abrasion, solution, and cavitation, with the rate of erosion being influenced by factors such as river velocity, volume, and the resistance of underlying materials. 

Transportation moves eroded materials downstream in several ways, including solution, suspension, saltation, and traction, with the size and density of the material determining the method. Faster-flowing rivers can carry larger particles, while slower-flowing rivers are limited to finer sediments. Deforestation can increase soil erosion and sediment runoff into rivers.
