The study of crowd psychology examines the ways people behave in groups, and goes beyond simple numbers to delve into the interactions within these groups. Gustave Le Bon proposed that individuals in crowds undergo a transformation, losing their rationality and adopting a "collective mind" characterized by impulsivity and irrationality, where crowds are swayed by emotions and charismatic leaders. Emotions and behaviors can rapidly spread through a crowd, escalating into a collective frenzy, because people mimic othersâ€™ actions, in a phenomenon known as social contagion. However, crowds can also be a force for positive change in protests and demonstrations. Additionally, crowds can exhibit emergent norm theory, where new behaviors and norms emerge. Understanding the psychology of crowds is crucial in law enforcement, urban planning, and political science to help prevent violence, facilitate gatherings, and harness crowds for social good.
