Cahokia, located in the Mississippi River Valley near modern-day St. Louis, Missouri, flourished as the largest pre-Columbian city north of Mexico between approximately 1050 and 1350 CE. Its rapid rise was supported by a favorable climate and agricultural innovation, particularly the adoption of a highly productive variety of maize. This led to surplus food production, allowing the population to grow and enabling the specialization of labor. The city was characterized by its skilled artisans, builders, and political leaders, who transformed small villages into a complex urban center dominated by massive earthen mounds, with Monks Mound being a notable example. Central to Cahokia's identity were its massive earthen mounds, constructed over generations. Monks Mound, the largest, stands over 100 feet tall and covers 14 acres, dwarfing even the pyramids of Egypt in terms of its base size. These mounds served as platforms for temples, residences of the elite, and stages for public ceremonies, reflecting a hierarchical social structure and a complex religious belief system.

The presence of elaborate burial sites underscores the concentration of power in the hands of a few. However, Cahokia's impressive achievements proved unsustainable, and the city experienced decline around 1250 CE due to environmental degradation and resource depletion. Social instability and the concentration of power may have further contributed to its downfall. By the mid-14th century, Cahokia was largely abandoned.
