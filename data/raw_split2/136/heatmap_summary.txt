The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century marked a significant point in history, revolutionizing the spread of information. It affected literacy, religion, and science.

Before the printing press, books were copied by hand, which made them rare and expensive, available only to the elite. Printing reduced the cost and increased the availability of books, which led to increased literacy rates. Initially, religious texts and classical literature were the most common publications. As printing technology improved, subjects like history and law also emerged.

The printing press played a pivotal role in the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther's "Ninety-Five Theses," criticizing the Catholic Church, were quickly printed and disseminated throughout Europe, challenging the Church's authority. The ability to distribute religious texts allowed reformers to bypass traditional channels of control.

Governments and religious authorities attempted to control the flow of information by censoring publications deemed subversive. The printing press laid the foundation for mass communication, education, and the development of modern science.
