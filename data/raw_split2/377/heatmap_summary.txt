Artificial light at night (ALAN) has become an omnipresent feature of the modern world and poses a significant threat to wildlife. ALAN can disorient nocturnal animals, leading them astray and increasing the risk of collisions with buildings. Millions of birds die annually from collisions with brightly lit buildings during migration. Sea turtle hatchlings may crawl towards artificial lights instead of the ocean, leading to dehydration. ALAN disrupts the natural rhythms of animal behavior, affecting foraging, reproduction, and predator-prey interactions. Melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep, is suppressed by exposure to light. The chronic suppression of melatonin can have detrimental effects on animal health and fitness.

Fungi are indispensable organisms that play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystems. Fungi exist primarily as extensive networks of thread-like hyphae within the soil, forming vast mycelial networks. They engage in decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant symbiosis. Fungi break down complex organic matter, releasing essential nutrients back into the soil, ensuring the availability of elements like nitrogen and phosphorus. Fungi also transport nutrients and water over long distances, benefiting plants. Mycorrhizal associations support the growth and survival of plant species.

Fungi can protect plants from diseases and enhance their resistance to herbivores. They serve as food for various animals and support complex food webs. Threats to fungal diversity include habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts should focus on preserving natural habitats and reducing pollution.
