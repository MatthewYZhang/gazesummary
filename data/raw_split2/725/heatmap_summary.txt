The Mesoamerican landscape's diverse climates, varying altitudes, and patchy resource distribution influenced the rise of urban centers. Mesoamerica, unlike river valley civilizations, lacked extensive navigable waterways, shaping settlement patterns and resource management.

Early societies like the Olmec centered on ceremonial complexes in the humid lowlands of the Gulf Coast, serving as religious and craft production hubs. Their reliance on agriculture in swampy environments limited expansion. The Olmec developed drainage systems but remained confined to coastal plains. In contrast, central Mexico's highlands offered a diverse environment suitable for agriculture and valuable resources like obsidian.

Teotihuacan became a dominant power in this region, flourishing between 100 BCE and 550 CE, controlling trade routes and obsidian sources. Its urban layout reflected an organized society. The Maya in the Yucatan Peninsula developed independent city-states competing for resources, known for architecture, hieroglyphic writing, and astronomy, and established trade networks, exchanging goods with other regions of Mesoamerica. The Aztec, who arrived in the Valley of Mexico in the 13th century CE, were the last major civilization to dominate Mesoamerica. They built their capital city, Tenochtitlan, on an island in Lake Texcoco. Through a combination of military conquest, political alliances, and tribute collection, the Aztec established a vast empire.

Despite diverse environments, Mesoamerican urban centers shared characteristics as religious, political, and economic power centers with monumental architecture and craft production.
