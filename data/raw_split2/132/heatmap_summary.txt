Bird migration is a phenomenon that has intrigued humans for centuries. Billions of birds undertake extensive migrations between breeding and wintering areas annually. Scientists have made progress in understanding the mechanics and environmental cues of bird migration, but the precise navigation abilities and complex decision-making processes that enable these epic journeys remain mysterious. Songbirds, weighing less than an ounce, travel thousands of miles from Canada to Central or South America, facing unpredictable weather, scarce resources, and predators. Despite these challenges, the birds often return to the same breeding and wintering locations, exhibiting accuracy and resilience. While early theories suggested that birds followed landmarks or rivers, scientists now know that they use a variety of cues, including the Earth's magnetic field and polarized light, and possess specialized cells to detect magnetic fields. Attaching tracking devices like geolocators and GPS tags to birds is one method used to gather data on their routes. Scientists also study the genetics of migratory birds to determine how migration has evolved. Understanding migration patterns is crucial for effective conservation strategies to protect migratory birds, which face numerous threats, including habitat loss.

Origami, the ancient Japanese art of paper folding, uses a single sheet of paper without cuts or glue to create complex shapes. The basic principle of origami requires precision and patience, and artists often use different types of paper. Origami originated in ancient Japanese rituals and has evolved into a popular form of entertainment. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in origami due to its engineering and architectural applications. Its principles have been used to design deployable structures and foldable electronics. Modular origami involves combining multiple units to form larger structures. Origami is accessible to all ages and skill levels and can transform simple materials into works of art.
