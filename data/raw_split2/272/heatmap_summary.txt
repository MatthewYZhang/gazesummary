Fairy circles, a peculiar phenomenon in arid landscapes, are circular patches of bare earth surrounded by a ring of taller, denser vegetation. The origin of these fairy circles is attributed to termite activity, wherein termites create bare patches by consuming vegetation within the circle, disrupting the water cycle and preventing plant growth. The surrounding vegetation thrives due to increased water availability, but termite theory faces challenges, as not all fairy circles contain termites.

An alternative explanation focuses on self-organizing vegetation patterns driven by water stress, with plants competing for water resources. Local instabilities and chance events lead to bare patches that act as water sinks, weakening surrounding plants and forming stable fairy circles. Computer simulations support this hypothesis, revealing evidence of increased water infiltration within fairy circles.

A growing consensus suggests that the explanation may involve a combination of both termite and self-organization factors. Future research is needed to unravel the mystery of fairy circles by investigating interactions between vegetation, soil, water, and termites to provide insights into arid landscapes and climate change.
