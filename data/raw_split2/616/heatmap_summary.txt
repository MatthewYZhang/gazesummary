The Maya civilization flourished in Mesoamerica from approximately 250 AD to 900 AD, known as the Classic Period, characterized by independent city-states. They were renowned for their sophisticated writing system, advanced mathematics, and impressive architectural achievements. Their cultural influence extended across present-day southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. The Maya society was highly stratified, and most of the population consisted of farmers who cultivated crops like maize, beans, and squash. Cities like Tikal, Palenque, and Copán served as centers of power, each ruled by a king. 

The Maya developed a sophisticated writing system using glyphs, and their mathematical system included the concept of zero. Their calendar system consisted of several interlocking cycles. Religion played a central role, with a pantheon of gods and goddesses, and priests were responsible for interpreting the will of the gods. Around the 9th century AD, the Maya civilization declined, possibly due to environmental degradation, overpopulation, warfare, and political instability. As the southern cities declined, the center shifted to the northern Yucatán Peninsula, eventually succumbing to Spanish conquest. Despite this, their cultural legacy endures, and millions of Maya people continue to live in Mesoamerica.
