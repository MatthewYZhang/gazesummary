The Serengeti ecosystem is a vast and complex region in northern Tanzania and southwestern Kenya, renowned for its annual migration of wildebeest, zebra, and gazelle, a spectacular natural phenomenon often referred to as the Great Migration. The Serengeti is primarily a savanna with grasslands interspersed with scattered acacia trees, experiencing a seasonal climate that profoundly affects the availability of resources and drives the migratory patterns of herbivores.

The abundance of herbivores is a key feature, with wildebeest being the most numerous, followed by zebra and various species of gazelle. These herbivores consume vast quantities of vegetation. The herbivore populations support a diverse array of predators, including lions, cheetahs, leopards, hyenas, and African wild dogs, which regulate herbivore numbers and affect their distribution. The predator-prey interactions are a constant dance of pursuit and evasion.

In addition, fire is also a significant ecological factor in the Serengeti, where naturally occurring wildfires help to maintain the open grasslands. The Serengeti ecosystem faces challenges such as human activities, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. Conservation efforts are essential for protecting the ecosystem. Research and monitoring are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Serengeti ecosystem and informing conservation strategies. The Great Migration make it a global treasure, where the Serengeti continues to thrive.
