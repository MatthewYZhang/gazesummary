Ecologists have raised concerns about the global decline of amphibians, including frogs, toads, salamanders, and caecilians. This decline, which significantly threatens biodiversity and ecosystem health, is linked to complex factors like habitat loss, pollution, climate change, and infectious diseases. Habitat loss is a primary driver, with deforestation for agriculture, urbanization, and logging leading to the loss of breeding grounds, foraging areas, and shelter. Wetlands, crucial for many species, are often drained or filled, fragmenting habitats, isolating populations, and reducing genetic diversity. Pollution from pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers contaminates water sources, directly harming amphibians, and industrial pollutants can accumulate in tissues, impairing immune and reproductive systems. Climate change exacerbates these challenges, as altered temperature and precipitation disrupt breeding, food availability, and increase extreme weather events, forcing species to move or adapt. Chytridiomycosis, a fungal disease caused by *Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*, infects skin, disrupting water and electrolyte balance and has caused massive die-offs globally, facilitated by human activities like trading amphibians, with no effective treatment in wild populations. Researchers are working to address this decline.
