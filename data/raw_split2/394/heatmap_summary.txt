The deep-sea anglerfish is a creature that thrives in the extreme environment of the deep sea. A striking feature of anglerfish is their use of bioluminescence. They possess a fleshy growth called an esca that protrudes from their head and dangles in front of their mouth. The esca is tipped with photophores that contain symbiotic bacteria that produce light through a chemical reaction. The anglerfish can control the intensity and flickering of the light to attract unsuspecting prey. The effectiveness of the anglerfish's lure relies on the transparency of the deep-sea water, allowing the bioluminescent glow to travel considerable distances. They also have sensory adaptations to compensate for the absence of light, relying on their lateral line system to detect vibrations and pressure changes in the surrounding water. Some anglerfish species have a unique reproductive strategy where the males are drastically smaller than the females and become parasitic, fusing onto the female's body. The anglerfish represents how evolution can shape organisms to thrive in extreme environments.
