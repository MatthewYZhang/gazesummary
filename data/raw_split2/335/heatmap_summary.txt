Coral reefs, often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea," are among Earth's most biologically diverse ecosystems, offering habitat, food, and shelter for various marine organisms. These intricate structures are built by colonies of tiny animals known as coral polyps. Coral reefs are formed in clear, shallow, tropical, and subtropical waters. The symbiotic relationship between coral polyps and microscopic algae called zooxanthellae is crucial to reef health. Zooxanthellae reside within the coral tissues, providing essential nutrients through photosynthesis. In return, the coral protects the algae and provides access to sunlight, enabling corals to thrive in nutrient-poor waters. However, they face numerous threats, making understanding their ecological dynamics vital. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these valuable ecosystems. The loss of coral reefs would have devastating consequences for marine biodiversity, coastal communities, and the global economy.
