Cahokia, once the largest urban center north of Mexico, thrived in the Mississippi River Valley as part of the Mississippian culture. Its success was closely related to agriculture, particularly cultivating maize, beans, and squash. This reliable food supply led to population growth and a specialized workforce. Intensive farming methods, including raised garden beds and soil management, maximized crop yields.

The fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River supported trade networks across the Mississippi Valley. Cahokia's identity was also defined by the monumental earthen mounds. These structures, built through the labor of thousands, served as platforms for temples and residences for the elite. Monks Mound, the largest structure, suggests a point of religious and political power. The construction unified the population and reinforced the authority of the ruling elite.

However, Cahokia eventually declined, possibly due to environmental degradation, such as soil erosion and deforestation. Social unrest, resulting from the hierarchical structure, may have also contributed. Defensive palisades suggest concerns about external threats or internal instability. Rival polities and epidemics might also have played a role in Cahokia's decline. Whatever the factors, Cahokia's abandonment marked a turning point in Mississippian culture, teaching cautionary tales about sustaining complex societies.
