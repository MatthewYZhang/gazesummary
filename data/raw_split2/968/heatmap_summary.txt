Around 1050 A.D., a remarkable urban center flourished in the fertile floodplain where the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers converge. This city, known as Cahokia, became the largest settlement of the Mississippian culture, a sophisticated agricultural society. Cahokia's rise was linked to its agricultural productivity, with intensive maize agriculture. This surplus supported a growing population and specialized labor, leading to the construction of monumental earthen mounds. The inhabitants constructed monumental earthen mounds, impressive public works that served as platforms for temples, residences of elites, and community gathering places. The largest, Monks Mound, is a testament to Cahokia's engineering prowess and remains the largest earthen structure in North America. Beginning around 1250 A.D., however, the city experienced a decline marked by environmental degradation. By the 14th century, Cahokia was largely abandoned. The rise and fall of Cahokia serves as a reminder of the fragility of societies and the importance of sustainable resource management. In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, skeletal remains from Cahokia show a marked increase in signs of nutritional stress and infectious disease.
