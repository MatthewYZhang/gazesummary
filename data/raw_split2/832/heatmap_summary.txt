Crowds are a ubiquitous aspect of human societies, ranging from spontaneous gatherings to organized events, attracting the attention of researchers from various fields. Early crowd psychology, exemplified by Gustave Le Bon's work, posited that individuals in crowds lose their rationality and personal responsibility, becoming susceptible to a "group mind," which is characterized by heightened emotions, suggestibility, and reduced critical thinking. Le Bon believed crowds are irrational and prone to violence, driven by primitive instincts. 

While Le Bon's theory has been criticized for its negative portrayal, it highlights anonymity and diffusion of responsibility. Modern research challenges the notion of a single "crowd mind," as social identity theory suggests individuals identify with particular groups and engage in collective actions. Furthermore, crowds are not always manipulated; emergent norm theory proposes that norms can emerge spontaneously, providing a framework for coordination. Understanding the psychology of crowds is crucial for managing gatherings and preventing unrest through clear communication, crowd control measures, and fostering shared identity.
