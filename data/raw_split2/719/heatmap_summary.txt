Over the past two decades, alarming declines in honeybee populations, known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), have been reported globally. This phenomenon, characterized by the sudden disappearance of adult worker bees, leaving behind the queen and a few young bees, poses a significant threat to both global agriculture and ecosystems, making the understanding of its causes and potential solutions a critical area of research. The decline in honeybee populations has far-reaching consequences, potentially impacting agricultural yields and the overall health of the environment. Several factors are implicated in the decline, including neonicotinoid pesticides, which disrupt the nervous system of bees, impairing their navigation, foraging behavior, and immune function. Another significant threat is the Varroa mite, an external parasite that weakens bees and transmits viruses. Habitat loss and climate change, which disrupts flowering and extreme weather events, contribute to the decline. Scientists and beekeepers are working to reduce pesticide use, control Varroa mites, and restore bee-friendly habitats, with the goal of understanding and mitigating the stressors that threaten honeybee survival. Sustainable practices and bee-friendly policies are vital for ensuring continued pollination and biodiversity.
