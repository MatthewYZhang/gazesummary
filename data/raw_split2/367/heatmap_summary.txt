Bird migration, involving billions of individuals, is a spectacle that has puzzled observers for centuries. While migration is well-established, the mechanisms and selective pressures remain subjects of scrutiny. Early explanations were based on folklore, with some believing birds hibernated or transformed. Systematic bird banding and ecological studies have revealed that migration is driven by resource availability, climate, and predator avoidance.

One hypothesis emphasizes food scarcity, as insect populations and plant resources decline in winter, making it difficult for birds to survive. Migration to warmer areas allows birds to maintain a food supply. Another theory focuses on climate, with harsh winters impacting bird survival. Migrating to warmer climates reduces the risk of frostbite. Another theory suggests that migration is driven by a desire to avoid predators and parasites. Birds escape local predators and reduce exposure to disease. Birds navigate during migration using the Earth's magnetic field, the sun, stars, landmarks, and smells. Despite research, the enigma of bird migration persists. Migration is likely driven by an interplay of ecological, physiological, and evolutionary forces.
