Cahokia, the largest urban center of the Mississippian culture located near Collinsville, Illinois, thrived from approximately 800 to 1400 CE. This culture demonstrated sophisticated social organization, agricultural practices, and engineering capabilities. The fertile floodplain of the Mississippi River provided an ideal setting for agricultural innovation, allowing Mississippian peoples to develop a productive maize-based agriculture supplemented by beans, squash, and other crops. The agricultural surplus supported a large and concentrated population, allowing for specialization of labor and the development of a complex social hierarchy. Cahokia reached its peak with an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 residents in its core area.

However, Cahokia's prosperity declined by the 14th century, with its population dispersing because of factors like resource depletion, soil erosion, climate change, internal conflict, and political instability. Disease outbreaks and the introduction of new diseases could have further weakened the population. Cahokia's rise and fall serve as a cautionary tale about the fragility of even the most advanced societies, offering insights into the challenges of managing resources, maintaining social cohesion, and adapting to environmental change.
