Cahokia, located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois, represents the largest and most influential urban settlement of the Mississippian culture. Around 1100 CE, Cahokia boasted a population estimated between 10,000 and 20,000, exceeding that of many contemporary European cities. The impressive earthworks, including monumental mounds, palisades, and plazas, testify to a complex social structure, advanced agricultural practices, and sophisticated astronomical knowledge. This civilization experienced a decline and eventual abandonment, presenting archaeologists with a fascinating puzzle.

The foundation of Cahokia's success rested on intensive maize agriculture, made possible by the Mississippi River. This high-yield crop allowed for a surplus that supported a large, non-agricultural population. Archaeological evidence suggests that Cahokiaâ€™s inhabitants possessed a deep understanding of astronomy. Despite its impressive achievements, Cahokia experienced a decline beginning in the 13th century. Pollen analysis and sediment studies have revealed evidence of significant environmental shifts during this period, suggesting that Cahokia may have been vulnerable to climate variability.
