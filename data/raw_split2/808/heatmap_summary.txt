Animal migration, the seasonal movement of animals, has intrigued scientists for centuries. The reasons behind these journeys remain under investigation, with theories suggesting that food availability drives migration. Animals migrate to follow seasonal food abundance, like wildebeest in the Serengeti following rains and fresh grasses. However, this theory doesn't explain all migrations, especially when adequate resources exist in original locations. Breeding opportunities are another key factor, with animals migrating to specific locations offering optimal conditions for nesting, protection, or nutrients, like salmon returning to natal streams to spawn. Sea turtles also migrate long distances to lay eggs on beaches with suitable sand temperatures.

Recent research highlights the role of environmental cues and inherited instincts in guiding migration. Animals use sun position, the Earth's magnetic field, stars, and polarized light for navigation. Some species possess an innate compass sense passed down through generations. Monarch butterflies, for example, rely on magnetic cues and sun position for their multi-generational migration. The evolutionary origins of migration suggest that animals gradually moved to more favorable locations to survive, exploiting seasonal resources. Many aspects of animal migration are still mysterious. Human activities increasingly impact migration through habitat loss and climate change. Understanding migration is essential for effective conservation strategies to protect these journeys.
