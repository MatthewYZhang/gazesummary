The Olmec civilization, which thrived in Mesoamerica from approximately 1600 to 400 B.C.E., is known as the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica. The Olmecs laid the foundation for later civilizations such as the Maya and the Aztec. Their influence extended throughout the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and its effects can be observed in art, religion, social structure, and technological innovation. The Olmecs were skilled traders who exchanged goods, such as rubber, cacao, feathers, and obsidian with other regions of Mesoamerica. This trade network contributed to the development of other civilizations by spreading Olmec culture and ideas. The reasons for its decline are debated by scholars, but environmental changes, internal conflicts, and external pressures are some potential factors. The Olmecs left a legacy and profoundly influenced the region's subsequent development. The negative impacts of artificial light can be addressed through responsible lighting practices, public education, and promoting awareness of darkness to protect human health and preserve the environment.
