Bird migration, a phenomenon that has captivated observers, involves millions of birds undertaking long journeys annually in search of food, breeding grounds, and suitable climates. Initially attributed to hibernation or species transformation, these seasonal disappearances are now being unraveled by modern science, revealing complex mechanisms. Birds employ diverse cues for navigation, including the Earth's magnetic field, the sun, stars, and polarized light, with specialized cells aiding the detection of magnetic north. They also learn migration routes from experienced adults, passing down knowledge.

The energetic demands of migration require birds to build up fat reserves and conserve energy through flock flying and gliding on thermal updrafts. Climate change disrupts migratory schedules, leading to mismatches in arrival times and resource availability. Challenges along the way include habitat loss, collisions, and predation, necessitating conservation efforts. The study of bird migration continues to unveil insights into the abilities of avian travelers, emphasizing the importance of understanding and protecting their behaviors.
