Animal migration, a phenomenon that has fascinated scientists for centuries, involves the large-scale movement of a species from one place to another. The reasons, navigation, and adaptations behind these journeys are subjects of research, driven by seasonal changes or other cues. A primary driver is the search for food, particularly in temperate and arctic regions where species migrate to capitalize on seasonal booms in food. For example, wildebeest migrate in the Serengeti for fresh grazing lands, while many birds fly south in the winter when insects become scarce. However, migration also occurs for breeding, offering optimal conditions for raising young, including access to nesting materials and reduced predator pressure. Some species utilize a variety of cues to find their way, including the Earth's magnetic field, the sun, and even smell to navigate back to their natal streams. Other animals learn the migration routes from their elders. Climate change poses threats to migration patterns by reducing food availability.
