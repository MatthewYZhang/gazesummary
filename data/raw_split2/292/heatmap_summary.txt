Coral reefs, often called the "rainforests of the sea," are complex underwater ecosystems in tropical and subtropical oceans. These reefs, built by tiny coral polyps, boast astonishing marine life diversity and are crucial to ocean health. The coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate to build hard skeletons, which accumulate over time to form coral reefs. Microscopic algae, called zooxanthellae, reside within coral polyp tissues, sharing a symbiotic relationship, providing energy to the coral and shelter and nutrients to the algae.

Coral reefs face unprecedented threats. Climate change, a primary threat, causes coral bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures and coral expelling zooxanthellae. Prolonged bleaching can kill the coral. Pollution, including runoff, and destructive fishing practices also cause harm. Despite these issues, reefs show remarkable resilience, and some species tolerate heat stress. Reefs can recover if given time and reduced stress. Marine protected areas provide refuge, and research identifies climate-change-resistant species. Transplanting corals grown in nurseries to degraded reefs is another approach. Local actions like reducing pollution and restoring degraded reefs can make a difference.
