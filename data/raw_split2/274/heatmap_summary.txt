For centuries, the navigational abilities of animals have intrigued humans, from the migrations of monarch butterflies to the homing instincts of pigeons. Researchers are working to unravel the secrets behind these feats. A key element in animal navigation is the use of environmental cues. Many animals rely on visual landmarks to orient themselves, and birds use constellations of stars to maintain direction. However, visual cues are not always available, and animals may rely on other senses, such as smell. Salmon, for example, use their olfactory senses to navigate back to their natal streams. The most intriguing aspect of animal navigation is the ability to sense the Earth's magnetic field, with two main hypotheses about how animals detect it. Some animals may also use internal clocks to navigate. Scientists are still working to understand how animals integrate different types of cues and how they learn to navigate, but the ability of animals to navigate has implications for conservation efforts.
