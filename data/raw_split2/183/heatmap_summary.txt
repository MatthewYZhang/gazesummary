The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized medicine by enabling the effective treatment of bacterial infections, but the widespread use has led to antibiotic resistance. This phenomenon occurs when bacteria evolve mechanisms to survive exposure to antibiotics, rendering these drugs ineffective. Antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process driven by natural selection; when bacteria are exposed to an antibiotic, resistant bacteria survive, reproduce, and pass on their resistance genes. Overuse of antibiotics in human medicine and the routine use of antibiotics in livestock production contribute to the development and spread of resistance. Agriculture exposes bacteria to antibiotics, creating a reservoir of resistant bacteria that can spread to humans. Addressing the crisis of antibiotic resistance requires a multi-faceted approach, including reducing inappropriate use of antibiotics, public education, stricter regulations, and phasing out routine use in agriculture. Research and development of new antibiotics are also essential to stay ahead of the evolving resistance.
