Around 1050 A.D., in the fertile floodplains of what is now southwestern Illinois, a remarkable civilization, known as the Mississippian culture, blossomed and built a city of unparalleled scale and sophistication called Cahokia. Thriving until about 1350 A.D., Cahokia became a hub of trade, agriculture, religion, and social organization. Cahokia’s rise and eventual decline offer insights into the interplay of environmental factors, social dynamics, and political structures in pre-Columbian North America.

Cahokia’s strategic location was central to its success, as its fertile soil provided ground for maize agriculture. They cultivated maize, beans, and squash – known as the "Three Sisters." Cahokia also had a complex social hierarchy and the Mississippi River provided a vital transportation route. Despite its initial success, Cahokia ultimately declined in the 14th century due to environmental degradation, overpopulation, resource depletion, and social unrest.
