Rivers constantly shape landscapes through erosion, transportation, and deposition. These processes are governed by universal principles, but the characteristics of each river system, including gradient, discharge, sediment load, and geological setting, dictate the landforms that result. Erosion is the initial stage in this cycle. Rivers erode through hydraulic action, abrasion, solution, and cavitation. The relative importance of each process depends on the river's characteristics. Fast-flowing rivers in mountainous regions are dominated by hydraulic action and abrasion.

The eroded sediment is then transported downstream. The capacity of a river to transport sediment is directly related to its flow velocity and turbulence. Larger, heavier particles are transported as bedload, while finer particles are transported as suspended load. Deposition occurs when the river's energy decreases, resulting in landforms like floodplains, alluvial fans, deltas, and river terraces. The interaction between a river and its surrounding landscape is not unidirectional; the landscape also influences the river. The underlying geology determines the river's course and the types of sediment it erodes. The climate affects the river's discharge and the vegetation cover, which influences erosion rates. The Colorado River's carving of the Grand Canyon exemplifies this shaping power. The Amazon River, the largest in the world, shows how deposition can form vast floodplains and intricate ecosystems. Rivers are dynamic systems that shape the Earth's surface.
