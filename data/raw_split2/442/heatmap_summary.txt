Cahokia, located in the Mississippi River Valley, was a significant cultural and economic hub. The Mississippian culture was characterized by complex social structures, advanced agricultural methods, and impressive earthworks. Cahokia flourished between 1050 and 1350 CE but eventually declined, sparking intrigue among archaeologists and historians. Cahokia's origins are unclear, but archaeological evidence points to rapid population growth and cultural changes in the 11th century. The construction of large earthen mounds, including Monk's Mound, indicates a highly organized society capable of mobilizing labor. These mounds served as platforms for temples, elite residences, and ceremonial centers.

Cahokia's economy centered on agriculture, particularly maize, due to the fertile floodplains of the Mississippi River. They also cultivated beans, squash, and supplemented their diet through hunting and fishing. Sophisticated agricultural practices, such as crop rotation and terracing, increased productivity. Cahokia society was highly stratified, with a clear hierarchy between elites and commoners, and differences in burial practices, housing, and access to resources indicated social disparities. The ruling elite likely controlled agricultural production, trade, and religious practices, using monumental architecture like Monk's Mound to reinforce their authority.

Cahokia was a trade center, connecting various regions through waterways and trails, with evidence of exotic goods like copper, mica, and seashells. The city began to decline around 1350 CE due to factors such as environmental degradation from intensive agriculture, potentially leading to soil erosion and resource depletion. Social unrest or political instability due to power concentration among elites may have also contributed to tensions and resentment. Climate change, such as droughts or floods, and external factors like warfare or disease, may have also played a role. The decline of Cahokia marked the end of a significant chapter in North American history, leaving behind monumental mounds as a testament to the Mississippian culture.
