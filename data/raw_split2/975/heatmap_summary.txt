Fungi are often overlooked despite playing essential roles in terrestrial ecosystems, decomposing organic matter, cycling nutrients, and forming symbiotic relationships. They were once classified as plants but are genetically closer to animals, exemplified by their heterotrophic nature. Fungi, unlike plants, need to find or make their own food. Furthermore, the cell walls of fungi are made of chitin, also found in insect exoskeletons. The majority of fungi exist as a network of hyphae called the mycelium, which breaks down complex organic molecules for plants. Fungi form mycorrhizal associations with plant roots, enhancing nutrient and water absorption, while plants provide carbohydrates. They also have uses for humans, such as yeast in baking and *Penicillium* in antibiotics. Recent advances in DNA sequencing are aiding in their identification.
