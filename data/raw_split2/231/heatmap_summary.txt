Sleep is a dynamic process essential for restoration, characterized by NREM and REM stages, which are distinguished by brainwave activity, muscle tone, and physiological changes. NREM sleep, which makes up most of sleep time, includes stages 1 and 2, and SWS (stage 3 and stage 4). Stage 1 is the transition between wakefulness and sleep, and is characterized by slow eye movements and slower breathing. Stage 2 is a deeper stage and is characterized by even slower heart rate and breathing and body temperature drops. Stages 3 and 4 are SWS, during which the body repairs tissues and strengthens the immune system.

REM sleep is characterized by rapid eye movements and increased heart rate, and this stage is associated with dreaming, memory consolidation, and emotional processing. The sleep cycle, transitioning between NREM and REM, lasts 90-120 minutes, and disruptions to this cycle can have consequences for health. Prioritizing sleep and addressing disorders are essential, with strategies like a bedtime routine and optimizing the environment. Research into sleep stages is ongoing, promising to unlock secrets about sleep's role in health.
