Sleep, although seemingly a passive state, is a complex and vital biological process. It is characterized by reduced awareness, decreased motor activity, and altered physiological functions. Understanding sleep's purpose remains a challenge, though its universality suggests it meets fundamental needs.

Sleep follows a cyclical pattern with distinct stages, each having unique brainwave patterns. These stages are broadly categorized into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. NREM sleep is subdivided into stages 1 through 3. Stage 1 is a transitional phase marked by drowsiness and easily disrupted sleep, and it is characterized by drowsiness and easily disrupted sleep. Sleep deprivation can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections. The regulation of sleep is governed by the circadian rhythm, influenced by external cues, and the homeostatic sleep drive, reflecting the accumulated need for sleep.
