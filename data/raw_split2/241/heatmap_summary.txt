Agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, is a fundamental shift from nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to settled communities. It arose independently in multiple regions, starting around 12,000 years ago. One of the earliest centers was the Fertile Crescent, encompassing parts of modern-day Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran, where wild ancestors of wheat, barley, and lentils flourished. People began experimenting with cultivating these plants, initially by scattering seeds, eventually developing more sophisticated techniques like irrigation, fertilization, and crop rotation, leading to increased yields and a more reliable food supply. Agriculture in Mesoamerica included beans, squash, and chili peppers. Climate change and population growth played a role in agriculture's emergence. The adoption of agriculture allowed for the development of settled villages and towns, leading to increased population densities and specialization of labor. Agriculture also created a surplus of food, leading to the development of complex societies. It also led to social inequality and made people more vulnerable to famine. Despite these drawbacks, agriculture remains essential for feeding the world's growing population.
