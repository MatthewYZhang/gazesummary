The extinction of megafauna, giant mammals and birds, during the late Pleistocene epoch, a time of dramatic environmental change with fluctuating sea levels and ecosystems, has become a central question in paleontology, archaeology, and climatology. Across continents, species like woolly mammoths and saber-toothed cats disappeared, leaving a dramatically altered landscape.

Two primary hypotheses attempt to explain this extinction: climate change and human activity ("overkill"). The climate change hypothesis suggests that rapid temperature and vegetation shifts stressed megafauna beyond their ability to adapt, as grasslands were replaced by forests and tundra. The overkill hypothesis posits that human arrival and systematic overhunting drove megafauna to extinction.

However, the debate continues as critics argue megafauna survived previous cycles, and others suggest human populations were too small. Recent research suggests a synergistic effect, where climate change weakened populations, making them more vulnerable to human hunting or introduced diseases. The study of ancient DNA and pollen records provides insights into pre-extinction genetic diversity and human activity. Ultimately, unraveling this mystery informs biodiversity conservation in the face of climate change and human impacts.
