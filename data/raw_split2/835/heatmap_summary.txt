Roman civilization, known for its military might and political structure, significantly impacted the world through its remarkable engineering feats. Aqueducts provided water to bustling cities, while roads facilitated trade and conquest. Roman engineers possessed a deep understanding of materials, construction methods, and practical application, and their innovations shaped the Roman Empire and continue to influence modern engineering.

One of the core characteristics of Roman engineering was its focus on functionality and durability. Unlike the Greeks, who often prioritized aesthetics, the Roman engineers emphasized creating robust, efficient, and capable structures. This approach stemmed from the empire's vast territorial reach and the need to manage resources and infrastructure efficiently. Their legacy continues to impact modern engineering, and their emphasis on functionality, durability, and practicality remains a guiding principle for engineers.
