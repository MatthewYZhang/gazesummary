Play is a fundamental mechanism for children's cognitive development. It offers a unique context for exploration, experimentation, and knowledge acquisition. Play contributes to problem-solving abilities. When children play, they are constantly faced with challenges such as figuring out how to construct a tower of blocks or negotiating roles in a make-believe game. Play is essential for the development of language and communication skills. Children learn to use language to express their thoughts, intentions, and emotions and expand their vocabulary. Constructive play promotes spatial reasoning and fine motor skills, physical play enhances gross motor skills, and games with rules teach children about fairness and competition. The decline in unstructured play time in recent decades has raised concerns about its potential impact on children's cognitive development. Interactive and educational games can potentially enhance certain skills, such as problem-solving and spatial reasoning.
