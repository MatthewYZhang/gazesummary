The Maya civilization thrived in Mesoamerica, making advancements in mathematics, astronomy, and art. The rise of the Maya civilization was due to agricultural innovations like irrigation and terracing systems that supported a growing population. This led to a stable food supply through crops like maize, beans, and squash, which supported urbanization. They also developed a deep understanding of astronomy and mathematics. This helped them create accurate calendars and predict celestial events, crucial for agriculture. The Maya civilization's height was during the Classic period (250-900 AD), with city-states ruled by kings who claimed divine power. However, the decline began in the late Classic period with cities being abandoned. Several theories explain the collapse like environmental degradation, overpopulation, drought, warfare, and political instability. Deforestation and soil erosion reduced agricultural productivity, causing food shortages and unrest. Recent research suggests that a combination of factors, like a severe drought, contributed to the collapse. The civilization didn't disappear entirely, as some city-states in the Yucatan Peninsula thrived and developed new forms of art, architecture, and political organization.
