Before the late 19th century, local solar time prevailed. Each city operated on its own time based on the sun's position, where noon occurred when the sun reached its highest point. This system became chaotic due to the rise of long-distance travel and railway networks. Coordinating train schedules became challenging, leading to wrecks and delays that caused economic losses. Travelers were confused by resetting their watches, and the lack of standardization hindered commerce and communication. The solution came with standardized time zones advocated by Sir Sandford Fleming. The proposal divided the world into 24 zones, with each using the same time. The implementation was not without its challenges, including resistance to the artificiality and disruption of routines, but the practical advantages soon became undeniable. Railway companies adopted the system in 1883, and the U.S. Congress followed in 1918. Standardized time streamlined transportation and communication, and it boosted economic activity. However, the adoption of standardized time has profound and far-reaching consequences. It streamlined transportation, facilitated communication, and boosted economic activity. However, standardized time also introduced new complexities. Despite these challenges, standardized time zones remain a cornerstone of modern life.
