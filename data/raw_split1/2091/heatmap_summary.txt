Seaweeds, which are multicellular algae inhabiting oceans, share biological and ecological similarities despite their evolutionary differences. Most seaweed species are benthic, growing on diverse substrates like rock, sand, and coral, and some attach to specific surfaces or live on other organisms. These benthic seaweeds define the inner continental shelf, where marine life depends on them for food and protection.

The vertical distribution of red, brown, and green algae was once thought to correlate with their photosynthetic pigments and the depths at which certain light wavelengths penetrate. Red algae, with pigments absorbing green light, were expected to grow at the greatest depths, while green algae, absorbing blue and red light, were expected to grow at the shallowest. The greatest diversity of algal species occurs in tropical waters, with species number decreasing away from the equator. Some algae in colder latitudes are perennial. High temperatures in intertidal areas may cause mortality and ice can eliminate seaweeds at high latitudes.
