Dada was a movement mainly in France, Switzerland, and Germany from 1916 to 1923. Dada was based on the principles of deliberate irrationality and anarchy. It rejected laws of beauty and social organization and attempted to discover authentic reality through the destruction of traditional culture and aesthetic forms. Dada emerged from despair over the First World War and disgust for the conservative values of society, and it was the first expression of protest against the war. Dadaists used absurdity to create artworks that mocked society. The forerunner of the Dadaists, and ultimately their leading member, was Marcel Duchamp, who created his first “ready-made,” the Bicycle Wheel.

Fifty years after the Dadaists, the Pop movement of the 1960s embraced ordinary things, and Pop artists were curious about the commercial media of ads, billboards, newsprint, television, and all aspects of popular culture. The subject matter of Pop art was derivative, depicting comic strips, soft-drink bottles, and photographs of movie stars. Lichtenstein painted enlarged copies of comic strips and painted other pictorial styles, including blowups of other artists' brushstrokes and parodies of Cubism and Art Deco. Warhol showed his 32 Campbell's Soup Cans that mimic the condition of mass advertising, and his work flowed from one central insight: mass culture is filled with images that become meaningless by being repeated again and again, and celebrity replaced sacredness in art.
