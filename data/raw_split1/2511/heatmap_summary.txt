The article explores whether perceptual development is innate or socially acquired, arguing for an activity-dependent process. While most developmental scientists agree that both nature and nurture are essential, there is still dispute. The author argues classifying aspects of perceptual development as either innate or learned presents an overly passive view. Neurons are specialized cells that transmit messages to other neurons, glands, and muscles. Neurons involved in binocular vision show prenatal tuning arising from internally generated electrical activity. Neurons continue to be tuned after birth, reflecting the external world.  Infants' eye movements to visual targets suggest they actively contribute to their development, and their brain specialization for faces develops over time. Experiments with young infants showed dramatic changes in perceptual abilities. The article concludes infants are not passively shaped, but rather perceptual development is an activity-dependent process, which during postnatal life, the infant plays an active role in generating the experience it needs for subsequent development.
