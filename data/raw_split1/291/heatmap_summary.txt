According to conventional theory, yawning is believed to occur when people are bored or sleepy, serving to increase alertness by reversing the drop in blood oxygen levels caused by shallow breathing associated with these states. However, scientific investigations have struggled to establish a consistent connection between yawning frequency and sleep or tiredness. Yet, some research indicates that adults yawn more on weekdays compared to weekends, and school children tend to yawn more frequently in their first year of primary school than in kindergarten.

Additionally, the idea that yawning raises alertness or physiological activity has been challenged. While some studies showed skin conductance increases, similar changes occur when subjects simply open their mouths or breathe deeply, suggesting yawning doesn't uniquely influence physiological activity. Experiments have also questioned the notion that yawning is triggered by changes in blood oxygen or carbon dioxide levels, as altering these factors didn't affect yawning frequency.

An alternative theory suggests yawning plays a role in the physical development of the lungs early in life but lacks biological function in adults. It posits that yawning helps clear airways. However, the empirical evidence suggests yawning prepares individuals for a change in activity level.
