The epic poem *Beowulf*, written in Old English, is the earliest existing Germanic epic. Beowulf comes from Geatland, the southeastern part of what is now Sweden. Hrothgar, king of the Danes, lives near what is now Leire, on Zealand, Denmark's largest island. The Beowulf epic contains three major tales about Beowulf and several minor tales that reflect a rich Germanic oral tradition of myths, legends, and folklore. The Beowulf warriors have a foot in both the Bronze and Iron Ages. They carry iron-tipped spears, and their best swords have iron or iron-edged blades. Beowulf also orders an iron shield for his fight with a dragon. The Beowulf epic also reveals interesting aspects of the lives of the Anglo- Saxons who lived in England at the time of the anonymous Beowulf poet.

The identity of the Beowulf poet is also uncertain. He apparently was a Christian who loved the pagan heroic tradition of his ancestors and blended the values of the pagan hero with the Christian values of his own country and time.  Beowulf interests contemporary readers for many reasons, and each fight is unique, action-packed, and exciting. Second, Beowulf is a very appealing hero who chooses to risk death in order to help other people, and he faces his inevitable death with heroism and dignity. In Beowulf, as in the major epics of other cultures, the hero must create a meaningful life in a world that is often dangerous and uncaring.
