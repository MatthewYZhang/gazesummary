Industrial melanism is exemplified by the peppered moth, Biston betularia, in Europe's industrial regions over the last century. Originally, moths were primarily pale gray or whitish, with dark-colored individuals being rare. Over decades, dark-colored forms became more prevalent, particularly in industrialized areas. This was not due to genetic mutations from pollution. Melanics were normally eliminated in nonindustrial areas, but pollution promoted the survival of dark forms on soot-covered trees. The increase in the frequency of dark-colored mutants in polluted areas is called industrial melanism. A similar phenomenon occurred with Biston cognataria in North American cities like Chicago and New York.

Kettlewell developed the idea that natural selection was responsible for the changing ratio of dark- to light-colored peppered moths. Kettlewell also set up hidden observation positions and watched birds eat moths placed on tree trunks of a contrasting color. The mean concentration of sulphur dioxide pollution fell from about 300 micrograms per cubic meter in 1970 to less than 50 micrograms per cubic meter in 1975.
