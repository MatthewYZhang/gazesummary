Eventually, all stars consume their nuclear fuel, collapsing into one of three final states: white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole. White dwarfs are small stars with densities greater than any known terrestrial material. They begin as low to medium mass stars, and as a star ages, it collapses because it no longer produces sufficient radiant heat to counteract its gravity. Although some white dwarfs are no larger than Earth, their mass can equal 1.4 times that of the Sun, where a spoonful of such matter would weigh several tons. The surface becomes hot and very bright as the star contracts into a white dwarf, but without a continuing source of energy, it will slowly cool and dim. The terminal stage of a white dwarf is believed to be a small, cold, nonluminous body called a black dwarf. Neutron stars are remnants of supernova events. Remnants of stars greater than three solar masses apparently collapse into objects even smaller and denser than neutron stars, known as black holes. Anything that moves too near a black hole will be swept in by its irresistible gravity and annihilated.
