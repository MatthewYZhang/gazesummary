Venice achieved commercial dominance in southern Europe through its extensive trade in salt. Venice initially produced its own salt at the Chioggia saltworks. After floods destroyed a third of the ponds in Chioggia in the thirteenth century, Venice had to import more salt. The Venetians discovered that they could make more money buying and selling salt than producing it.

Beginning in 1281, the government subsidized merchants shipping salt to Venice. Shipping salt became so profitable that the merchants could ship other goods at prices that undersold competitors. Venice merchants could then send ships to the eastern Mediterranean, pick up Indian spices, and sell them in western Europe at low prices. Venice was paying high prices for salt, but they did not mind because they wanted to dominate the spice and grain trades. Venice would use its salt income to subsidize grain imports. Unlike the Chinese salt monopoly, Venice regulated trade, the salt administration also maintained Veniceâ€™s palatial public buildings and the complex hydraulic system. Wishing to raise the world market price, Venice destroyed all saltworks on Crete and banned local production, and aided its ability to control territory.
