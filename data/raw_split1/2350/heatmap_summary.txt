In 1870, the San Jose scale, an insect pest, arrived in California from Asia and quickly spread, devastating orchards. Farmers controlled it with sulfur and lime sprays, but the scales developed resistance. In Clarkston Valley, Washington, orchard growers suspected pesticide adulteration, but even pure poisons couldn't stop the scales. Entomologist A. L. Melander found scales thriving under dried spray and found that sulfur-lime could wipe out every last scale on a tree in Yakima and Sunnyside. In Clarkston between 4 and 13 percent survived. The scales of Clarkston had a peculiar resistance to sulfur-lime.

Melander suspected mutations made some scales resistant. Resistant scales survived spraying, bred, and passed on their genes, causing more resistant generations. Farmers in Clarkston Valley, by overusing sulfur-lime, unintentionally drove the evolution of resistant scales.

Melander suggested his ideas in 1914, but no one paid much attention to him; they were too busy discovering even more powerful pesticides.  In 1939 the Swiss chemist Paul MÃ¼ller found that a compound of chlorine and hydrocarbons called DDT could kill insects more effectively than any previous pesticide had.
