El Niño is a phenomenon where the cold Humboldt Current of the Pacific Ocean flows toward the equator along the coasts of Ecuador and Peru. When the current nears the equator, westward trade winds cause nutrient-rich cold water to rise from deeper levels, creating an upwelling with economic impacts. Fishing, particularly for anchovies, is a key local industry. Every year in December and January, a weak, warm countercurrent temporarily replaces the cold coastal waters, halting the upwelling of nutrients. This temporary condition is known as El Niño, meaning "the child."

Occasionally, the disruption lasts longer, raising water temperatures beyond the coast, leading to strong episodes that affect global weather. Sir Gilbert Walker discovered the Southern Oscillation, noting the link between El Niño and the Southern Oscillation, leading to the joint term ENSO. The Southern Oscillation swings in the opposite direction, reversing the typical conditions. This causes the warm water to flow eastward, triggering an El Niño. Scientists document historical El Niño events and have found that they are becoming more frequent and stronger, with the 1997-1998 El Niño bringing heavy rainfall to the southern United States.
