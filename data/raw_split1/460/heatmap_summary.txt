Groundwater accounts for most of the world's potable water and is stored in the pores and fractures of rocks. There is significantly more freshwater stored underground than in all the freshwater rivers and lakes at the surface, with nearly 50 percent stored in the upper 1,000 meters of Earth. At greater depths, the pressure of the overlying rock causes pores and cracks to close, reducing the space that pore water can occupy, with almost complete closure occurring at about 10 kilometers.

Groundwater is stored in a variety of rock types, and a groundwater reservoir from which water can be extracted is called an aquifer. Water will flow downhill to topographic lows. If the water table intersects the land surface, groundwater will flow out onto the surface at springs.
