At the end of the nineteenth century, there were basically two kinds of buildings in the United States: buildings produced for the wealthy or civic purposes, echoing the architecture of the past and traditional styles, and utilitarian structures like factories and grain elevators, employing modern materials in an undisguised manner. Modern architecture's development can be seen as adapting functional buildings for daily use, as highlighted by Le Corbusier's illustrations of American factories and silos. Modern architects consciously exploited the aesthetic possibilities of new materials like glass, which could open walls by using steel beams to span large spaces. The fundamental premise was that a building's appearance should exhibit its materials and physical support, creating effects that defied traditional architecture. Walls no longer needed to be solid, leading to designs like the Fagus shoe factory with glass corners. Steel beams enabled balconies without visible support, a signature of architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.

New technology transformed architectural design in high-rise office buildings. After ten or twelve stories, masonry construction reaches a height limit, while steel construction can support 50 or 100 stories, leading to the creation of skyscrapers. Real estate developers saw skyscrapers as increasing rental space, but challenges like access to upper floors were solved by updated elevators. Fire safety concerns were addressed by encasing metal in fire-retardant materials and using terra-cotta tiles, which are impervious to fire and lighter than masonry, reducing the overall weight of the structure.
