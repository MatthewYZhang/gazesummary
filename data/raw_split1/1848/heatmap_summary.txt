The planet Earth has undergone four stages of planetary development, a process shared by all terrestrial planets, although the extent and manner of evolution can vary. The first stage, differentiation, involves the separation of materials based on density, resulting in a dense core and a lower-density crust. This process would have been facilitated by Earth's early molten state, with heat from the impacts of in-falling material and the decay of radioactive elements contributing to the melting.

The second stage, cratering, saw the young Earth battered by meteorites. Although meteorites continue to strike Earth occasionally, cratering is no longer the dominant influence. The third stage, flooding, involved molten rock and water filling the basins. On Earth, flooding includes both lava and water. The fourth stage, slow surface evolution, involves constant changes as sections of crust slide over each other, push up mountains, and shift continents. 

Earth is peculiar due to the large amounts of liquid water, which covers 75% of its surface and leads to intense erosion. The presence of life and the impact of humankind are also unique.
