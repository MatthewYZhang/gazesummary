Sleep deprivation affects the brain and can impair short-term memory, coordination, reaction time, and judgment, posing risks of accident or injury. One study reported that sleep deprivation had hazardous effects similar to being drunk, finding that people who drove after being awake for 17 to 19 hours performed worse than those with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent, the legal limit for drunk driving in most western European countries. The study also found that 16 to 60 percent of road accidents involved sleep deprivation. The study suggests similar restrictions against sleep-deprived driving.

Sleep deprivation weakens the immune system, making one more prone to diseases such as the common cold and diabetes. Without sleep, the number of disease-fighting white blood cells decreases, as does the activity of the remaining white blood cells. It has also been linked to a decrease in insulin production. A recent study suggested that healthy young adults who regularly got under 6.5 hours of sleep a night had greater insulin resistance than people who got 7.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep. As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream, setting the stage for diabetes and heart disease.
