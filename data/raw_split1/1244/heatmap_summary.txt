The increasing human population is impacting Earth's atmosphere and ecosystems. The concentration of gases like carbon dioxide and methane is rising due to activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and the manufacturing of CFCs. About 70% of the sun's energy strikes Earth's surface and is reradiated as infrared radiation, some of which is absorbed by greenhouse gases and reradiated back to Earth. Without these gases, the Earth would be significantly cooler.

The IPCC predicts temperature increases with the doubling of carbon dioxide concentration.  Scientists are investigating how rising greenhouse gases will affect future global climates. Global circulation models project climate changes with doubled carbon dioxide. Models also indicate potential decreases in mid-latitude regions and increased rainfall in some tropical areas, accompanied by more extreme weather events.  Changes in climate, land use, and habitat destruction are dramatically decreasing biodiversity. Understanding the relation between climate and organisms is crucial to protect biodiversity.
