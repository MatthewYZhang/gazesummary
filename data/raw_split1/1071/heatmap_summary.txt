Income, occupation, and education are strong indicators of social standing. A layered model classifies people into upper, upper middle, middle, lower middle, and lower classes. Each class is defined by income, occupational prestige, and educational attainment, with wealth, education, and prestige decreasing from top to bottom. The upper class in the United States owns a substantial portion of the nation's wealth and exercises considerable societal control. They consist of families who have held wealth for generations and individuals who have recently become rich. Despite social myths, the family a person is born into is a major factor in determining their future wealth. Wealthy individuals are often listed in the Forbes 400, and most inherit significant assets. Those who acquire wealth recently are known as the nouveau riche, but they may not be accepted into established upper-class circles. Many Americans identify as middle class, though this group varies significantly in lifestyle and resources. The lower class is primarily composed of the displaced and poor, often with little formal education.
