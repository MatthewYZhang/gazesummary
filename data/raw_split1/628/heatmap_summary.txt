Navajo art includes floor paintings made by pouring streams of colored sands or pulverized vegetable and mineral substances. The Navajo artist will sift materials through their fingers to create imagery and chants. These paintings serve as memory aids during ritual songs. The Navajo gather to perform rituals with songs and make sand paintings to restore beauty and harmony to the world, especially when the world becomes ugly and disorderly. Some illness is itself regarded as a type of disharmony and the restoration of harmony can be part of a curing process. Men make sand paintings from the past. The songs sung over the paintings are faithful renditions of songs from the past. By recreating these arts, the Navajo bring beauty to the present world. The paintings generally illustrate ideas and events from the life of a mythical hero, who gave gifts of songs and paintings. Navajo women create new designs for every weaving they make, embodying dynamism. Weaving is a paradigm of the creativity of Spider woman who wove the universe.
