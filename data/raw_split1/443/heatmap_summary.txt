In southern Mesopotamia, the city of Uruk experienced significant growth, becoming a regional center and the first true city. Its inhabitants sustained themselves through agriculture, while a small portion of the urban population specialized in nonagricultural tasks, leading to the growth of various specialist craftspeople. The vast majority of Uruk's population remained active in agriculture. The Uruk period saw the use of undecorated utilitarian pottery, likely a result of specialized mass production, with the beveled-rim bowl as a characteristic example. These crudely made bowls were found throughout the Near East and produced rapidly in large amounts. Certain goods made by family members were made by skilled artisans. A specialized metal-producing workshop with channels and holes for molten metal was found at Uruk. During the late Uruk period, cylinder seals, small cylinders with carved scenes, emerged as a distinctive Mesopotamian object. The carved scenes were elaborate and refined, indicating the work of specialist stone-cutters.
