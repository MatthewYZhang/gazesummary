Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, changed the way we think about the development of children’s minds. Piaget's theory suggests that children actively construct their understanding of the world through four stages. Two processes underlie this cognitive construction: organization and adaptation. Organization involves making sense of the world by organizing experiences, like separating important ideas from less important ones and connecting ideas. Adaptation means adjusting to new environmental demands. Piaget offered two concepts to explain how children use and adapt their schemes: assimilation and accommodation. Assimilation happens when children use their existing schemes to deal with new information. Accommodation occurs when children adjust their schemes to take new information into account. For example, a toddler who has learned the word car may call all vehicles “cars,” assimilating them to their existing scheme. Later, the child learns to differentiate between cars, motorcycles, and trucks, accommodating their scheme. Finally, there are four age-related stages of development in understanding the world.
