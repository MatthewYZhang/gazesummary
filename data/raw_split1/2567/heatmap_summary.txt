Lizards can be categorized into two types based on their foraging behavior: sit-and-wait foragers and active foragers. Sit-and-wait lizards remain stationary, surveying a broad area, while active foragers spend their time moving on the ground surface. Sit-and-wait lizards visually detect and capture insects with quick bursts of movement, often targeting larger insects. Active foragers rely on chemical cues, seeking out concentrations of prey like termites. The different foraging strategies result in variations in their diets, even in shared habitats. Active foragers appear to eat more insects than sit-and-wait predators. Sit-and-wait lizards and active foragers differ in their relative emphasis on how long that activity can be sustained. Sit-and-wait lizards move in brief spurts and relies largely on anaerobic metabolism, which does not use oxygen. Lizards that rely on anaerobic metabolism can make brief sprints but become exhausted when they are forced to run continuously. As a result, active foragers can sustain activity for long periods without exhaustion.
