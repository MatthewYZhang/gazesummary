In the late nineteenth century, ecology emerged as an independent science, emphasizing community composition and structure. Early in the twentieth century, Frederic Clements noted that plant communities undergo succession after disturbances like volcanic eruptions, floods, or fires. Abandoned fields are gradually colonized by herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees, evolving into forests. Light-loving species typically initiate invasion, while shade-tolerant species follow later. Clements and other early ecologists perceived a lawlike regularity in succession, though this has not been fully substantiated, and is influenced by many factors. The climax, or final stage of succession, is also difficult to predict.

Despite criticism of terms like "climax" and "biome," the term "ecosystem" gained popularity, referring to the whole system of associated organisms and physical factors. Ecosystems involve the cycling, transformation, and accumulation of energy and matter through living organisms. The ecologist studies the amounts and rates of energy and matter moving through ecosystems. Although popular in the mid-20th century, the ecosystem concept is no longer the dominant paradigm, and ecologists are more focused on other aspects.
