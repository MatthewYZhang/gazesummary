The Americas were initially thought to be colonized via Beringia, a land bridge between Asia and Alaska, with an ice-free corridor allowing southward migration around 11,000-12,000 years ago. This theory was challenged when paleoecologist Glen MacDonald found that the radiocarbon dates supporting the ice-free corridor were incorrect, suggesting it existed much later.

An alternative theory suggests that people traveled by watercraft from Beringia along the Gulf of Alaska and the Northwest coast as early as 16,000 years ago, entering southern areas of the Americas before the continental glaciers melted.  Canadian archaeologist Knut Fladmark theorized that people gradually colonized unglaciated refuges using watercraft. The diversity of Native American languages along the west coast supports this idea, suggesting it was settled the longest. Recent geologic studies support the existence of ice-free areas in coastal British Columbia by 13,000 years ago, with the Northwest Coast largely ice-free around 16,000 years ago.

The coastal hypothesis suggests the initial colonization of America occurred along the Northwest Coast during the late Ice Age, possibly as early as 14,000 years ago. The economy was based on marine mammal hunting, fishing, and watercraft.
