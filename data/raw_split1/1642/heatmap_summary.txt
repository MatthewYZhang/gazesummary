The Triangle Waist Company fire in New York City was a devastating workplace disaster that highlighted the poor conditions faced by industrial workers, including low wages, long hours, and dangerous work environments. The factory, a typical sweatshop in the garment district, employed mostly women, some as young as 15, who were recent immigrants. Struggling with a new language and culture, these workers feared losing their jobs if they spoke out. On March 25, 1911, a fire started in a rag bin on the eighth floor. Workers tried to extinguish the flames, but their efforts failed. The factory manager found that the fire extinguisher hose was rotted and useless, and panic spread. The shirt factory occupied the top three floors of the Asch Building. Seventy employees who worked on the tenth floor escaped the fire by way of the staircases or by climbing onto the roof. Many workers chose to jump to their deaths rather than to burn alive. The fire killed 146 workers, mostly immigrant women. The Triangle fire illustrated inadequate fire inspections and safety precautions. The victims of the fire were trapped by the lack of fire escapes and by managementâ€™s practice of locking the exit doors during work hours.
