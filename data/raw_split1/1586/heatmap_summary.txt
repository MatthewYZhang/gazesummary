Emily Carr, born in 1871 in Victoria, British Columbia, developed a passion for nature and painting amidst a rugged landscape. She decided to become an artist in her early teens, and after her parents' death, she lived with her sister before attending art school in San Francisco, later studying in England and France. Carr's early paintings in Victoria and Vancouver were well received, but to make a living she supported herself by teaching art classes, raising dogs, and operating a boarding house.

Carr developed an early interest in painting the aboriginal culture of British Columbia and took her first sketching trip to Ucluelet. Her paintings of First Nations people documented their fishing villages, totem poles, and life in the forest. Recognized nationally in 1927, her paintings were exhibited in Toronto with the Group of Seven, leading to friendship with Lawren Harris. This exhibition established her as a leading figure in Canadian art.

At seventy, Carr started writing stories about her early life and aboriginal friends. Her first book, Klee Wyck, published in 1941, won the Governor-General's award. Art historians characterized her works as showing the influence of the Group of Seven, acknowledge that Carr produced paintings that were uniquely hers and credit her for raising Canadian art to a new height.
