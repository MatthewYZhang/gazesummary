The greenhouse effect, caused by gases like carbon dioxide, traps solar radiation, keeping Earth warm enough for life. Scientists are increasingly concerned about the human-driven rise in these gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This buildup is raising Earth's average surface temperature, causing a fast-paced change in global climate. Global warming may cause a rise in sea level by melting polar ice caps, accelerating coastal erosion and inundating low-lying areas.
Global warming has already left its fingerprint on the natural world. Two research teams recently reviewed hundreds of published papers that tracked changes in the range and behavior of plant and animal species, and they found ample evidence of plants blooming and birds nesting earlier in the spring.
The natural world is already responding dramatically to climate change. Changes in the environment will have an enormous impact on world biology. Birds especially play a critical role in the environment by pollinating plants.
