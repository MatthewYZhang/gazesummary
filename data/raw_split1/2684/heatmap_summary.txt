Structural plant defenses, such as tough leaves, spines, epidermal hairs, and hard-coated seeds, are cost-effective strategies to deter predators. Many seeds have thick, hard coats to provide protection. The problem with such seed defense is that the seeds need to be scarified so the seedling itself can escape. The role of structural defenses in plants was largely presumed until experimental evidence was sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of such apparent defensive structures against grazing herbivores. Researchers investigated experimentally the effects of plant spinescence on the feeding habits of three large browsing mammalian herbivores of Africa. Results clearly showed that thorns and spines affected the feeding behavior of the three ungulates.  The main effect of these armed structural defense features is to restrict bite size, thus increasing handling time. These experiments show that at least in some cases structural plant defenses are effective at protecting plants.
