William Smith was born in 1769 in Oxfordshire, England, to a poor blacksmith's family. Although his formal education was limited to rudimentary village schooling, he spent much of his time roaming his uncle's farm and collecting fossils from the abundant rocks of the Cotswold hills. As he grew older, Smith taught himself surveying from books, eventually becoming apprenticed to a surveyor at the age of eighteen. He then pursued geology independently. At twenty-four, he began working for the company excavating the Somerset Coal Canal in southern England.

Canal building was at its height during this time, with companies seeking surveyors to locate coal deposits and determine optimal canal routes. This job provided Smith with the opportunity to study fresh rock outcrops. As he collected fossils from strata throughout England, Smith realized that fossils told a different story from the rocks. The fossils in shale or sandstone were always the same. Some fossils only occur in a few strata, and a few species had their births and extinctions within one particular stratum. Fossils are thus identifying markers for particular periods in Earth's history. Smith could identify rock strata by the fossils they contained. By following the fossils, Smith was able to put all the strata of England's earth into relative temporal sequence.
