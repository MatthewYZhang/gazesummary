Plants have various adaptations to survive in cool environments. Deciduous trees in regions like northeastern North America lose their frost-sensitive leaves during winter, with new leaves emerging from viable winter buds in spring. Needle-leaved conifers, such as pines and firs, retain their leaves, escaping intracellular freezing at temperatures as low as -40℃ by undergoing physiological changes that either avoid freezing or restrict it to extracellular areas. To avoid freezing, plants chemically alter their liquids, analogous to antifreeze, enabling them to cool below 0℃ without freezing, a process called supercooling, which is achieved through the metabolic synthesis of sugars and molecules to lower the temperature for ice formation. Woody plants augment supercooling with declines in cellular water content and extracellular ice formation.

Cacti resist freezing by radiating stored heat, with larger cacti storing more heat. Young saguaros are sheltered by shrubs for warmth, but mature cacti rely on heat radiation. Saguaro range is limited by continuous freezing temperatures, as their heat reserve is insufficient beyond 24 hours.
