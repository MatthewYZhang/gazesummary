Exotic species, introduced deliberately or accidentally outside their home range, can negatively impact native species, sometimes leading to their endangerment or extinction. A prime example is the introduction of European rabbits into Australia in 1859. Initially intended for sport and food, the rabbits thrived due to the absence of natural predators.

Their population exploded, leading to overgrazing, bark stripping, and the transformation of grasslands into eroded deserts. Various control methods, including shooting, poisoning, and destroying warrens, proved insufficient. Even a 2,000-mile fence couldn't contain them. Later, government workers introduced the myxoma virus in 1951, which initially decimated the rabbit population but eventually led to the evolution of resistant strains. In 1991, scientists released a calcivirus, which has been effective, but its potential widespread use and long-term effects are being questioned.

Another exotic species is kudzu, a vine imported from Japan to the United States for erosion control. Without natural threats, it quickly spread, covering everything in its path. While efforts to eradicate it are largely ineffective, there's interest in using kudzu for starch production, logging reduction, and even as a source of paper.
