Rain forest soils, despite supporting lush plant growth, are often low in mineral nutrient content due to leaching. The soils contain particular types of clays that do not bind mineral ions well, and aluminum is the dominant cation, which can be toxic to plants and reduces phosphorus availability. Tropical soils contain far lower amounts of organic materials because high moisture and temperatures speed up the decomposition of organic compounds. The lack of organic materials contributes to the hard clay soils and makes them appear red or yellow due to the presence of iron, aluminum, and manganese oxides. Given the soilâ€™s poor state, tropical forests thrive because the minerals are held in the living biomass. Decomposers rapidly decay dead plant and animal matter, releasing minerals that are quickly absorbed by tree roots. Tropical rain forest plants often have mycorrhizal partners that absorb phosphorus and transfer mineral nutrients between plants. Tropical rain forests typically have closed nutrient systems, where minerals are handed off with little leaking into the soil, evolving in response to heavy rainfall. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria help cope with poor soil by supplying needed nitrogen.
