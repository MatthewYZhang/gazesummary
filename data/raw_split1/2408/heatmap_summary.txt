The Pacific Ocean, encompassing one-third of Earth's surface, is home to around 25,000 islands, with approximately 7,500 being oceanic and relatively distant from continental shores. Most Pacific islands originated barren of life, composed of volcanic rock. An exception is New Zealand, which is among the continental islands in the western Pacific, along with Fiji and the Solomons.

Life on many islands arrived by chance or drift, with some plants transported by air. Seeds carried in birds' digestive tracts account for about 40% of Hawaii's early plants. Initial colonizers were creatures or seeds capable of floating across oceans or surviving in birds' guts. Lower sea levels once connected islands, allowing colonization by less adept floaters. The western islands boast greater species diversity than the eastern islands of Polynesia, due to the survival of only the best floaters and travelers in the east. Mammals struggled to reach the island Pacific, with only bats and rats successfully colonizing east of New Guinea. Almost all species derive from Asia. The vulnerability of Pacific ecosystems increased due to the arrival of humankind. Island species lacked experience with human activities and terrestrial predators.
