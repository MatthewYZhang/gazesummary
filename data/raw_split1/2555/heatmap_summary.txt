Southeast Asia has a unique abundance and diversity of gliding animals that can glide through the tropical forest. It has been proposed that gliding is either a means of escaping predators or an energetically efficient way of traveling long distances between scattered resources. One theory, the tall-trees hypothesis, suggests the tall forests of Southeast Asia, dominated by dipterocarp trees, could allow for longer glides and the opportunity to build up speed. The lower wind speeds in tall-tree forests also contribute, though gliding animals are found throughout Southeast Asia, even in short-stature forests. Another theory, the broken-forest hypothesis, suggests that the tree canopy has fewer woody vines connecting tree crowns, forcing animals to glide between trees. A final theory suggests that dipterocarp trees drive the evolution of gliding species. These forests can be food-deserts as dipterocarp leaves are unavailable to most vertebrate plant eaters due to toxic chemicals. Gliding is a more efficient means of traveling to find leaves compared to descending to the ground. The lower abundance of prey in dipterocarp forests forces animals such as lizards and geckos to move between tree crowns.
