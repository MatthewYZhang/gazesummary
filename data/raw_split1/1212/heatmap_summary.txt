Forest succession is a continuous change in the species composition, structure, and function of a forest through time following disturbance. There are two major types of succession: primary and secondary. Primary succession is the establishment of vegetation on bare rocks or radically disturbed soil, while secondary succession is the reestablishment of vegetation following a disturbance that killed or removed the vegetation. Volcanic eruptions, retreating glaciers, and bare sand dunes are examples of sites subject to primary succession, while clear-cutting of forests, wild fires, and hurricanes are examples of sites subject to secondary succession. Hundreds to thousands of years are required for primary succession to reach the climax sere, compared to decades to hundreds of years for it to occur in secondary succession. A longer time is needed to reach the climax sere for primary than secondary succession because soil development must first take place in primary succession. 

Depending on the type and the severity of the disturbance, a moderate to large amount of dead organic matter from the previous forest remains on the site immediately from the disturbance. Light, nutrient, and water availability are highest during the early successional sere because the vegetation has not completely occupied the site. The intense intraspecies and interspecies competition induces the mortality of plants that are shaded or have one or more life-history characteristics that are not well adapted to the changing environment. The third stage is characterized by openings in the overstory canopy, and the forest canopy becomes more complex. Unique characteristics of old growth forests include large accumulation of standing and fallen dead trees. The annual input of forest litter is dominated by coarse woody debris. A pyric climax refers to an ecosystem that never reaches the potential climax vegetation because of frequent fires.
