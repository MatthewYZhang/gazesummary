Mass wasting processes encompass the downslope movement of rock, mud, or other materials due to gravity's influence. While slope angle is crucial, water availability during rainy seasons also plays a significant role, with earthquakes potentially triggering rockslides and mudflows. Vegetation presence and human activities also factor into mass wasting potential.

Classifying these processes involves considering the material, such as rock or mud, and the movement's nature, like a fall, slide, or flow. A fall occurs when weathering causes boulders to break away, while a slide happens when coherent material moves along a surface, and a flow involves debris mixed with water. Mudflows, rapid events involving soil and water, often follow canyons and stream channels in semiarid mountainous regions, sometimes linked to volcanic activity. Lahars, a type of mudflow originating in Indonesia, occur when volcanic ash and debris mix with water, flowing down volcanic slopes, such as those seen after Mount St. Helens' eruption.
