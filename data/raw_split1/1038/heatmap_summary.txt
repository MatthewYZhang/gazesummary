Following 30,000 B.C., Paleolithic art saw an artistic outburst, with artworks ranging from shell necklaces to cave paintings. The discovery of cave paintings in 1879 at Altamira sparked scholarly debate about why Old Stone Age hunter-artists covered cave walls with animal images. Explanations include mere decoration, but this theory fails to explain the narrow subject range and inaccessibility of many paintings. Scholars suggest prehistoric hunters attributed magical properties to the images, believing they could control animals by confining them to cave walls. Some theorize rituals or dances were performed to improve hunters' luck, while others propose the paintings served as teaching tools for new hunters. Conversely, some argue the paintings aimed to ensure the survival of herds. The central issue is that frequently painted animals were not staples of the Old Stone Age diet. Some scholars see sexual symbolism in abstract signs, but most theories have been discredited. That the paintings did have meaning to the Paleolithic peoples cannot be doubted. Some signs look like traps and arrows drawn to insure success in capturing or killing animals. Representations of human hands are also common, those around the Pech-Merle horses being "negative".
