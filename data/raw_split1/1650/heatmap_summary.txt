The Underground Railroad was developed during the peak of the antislavery movement in the 1800s. It was a loosely organized system of safe houses that helped runaway slaves flee north to free states or Canada. The term emerged in the 1830s from an Ohio clergyman. Due to its secretive nature, few records exist about the true number of people who used it.

Runaway slaves traveled alone or in small groups, typically young men between 16 and 35. They hid in wagons under loads of hay or potatoes, or in furniture and boxes, traveling by foot through swamps and woods. They used the North Star as a compass, sometimes moving in broad daylight, and occasionally disguised themselves as girls and boys. The "railroad" had its own language, where "trains" were wagons, "tracks" were back country roads, "stations" were safe houses, "agents" planned escape routes, "conductors" led slaves to freedom, and "passengers" were the slaves themselves. Harriet Tubman was a daring conductor who made 19 trips to the South to guide 300 people to freedom. Some white people, like Levi Coffin and his wife Catherine, also helped by hiding runaways. The Underground Railroad continued until slavery was abolished in 1865.
