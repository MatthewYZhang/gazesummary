Determining what extinct dinosaurs ate presents challenges, but inferences can be made regarding their dietary preferences. Traditionally, information is derived from direct evidence like stomach contents, and indirect evidence which includes establishing correlations between body characteristics and diets of living animals, then inferring habits for dinosaurs. Sharp teeth and claws serve as obvious predatory tools. Herbivores have flat teeth for grinding plant material, and jaws that move both side to side and front to back, allowing for transverse tearing, shredding, and compression of plant material.

Stomach contents are only rarely preserved, but when present, allow us to determine exactly what these animals were eating. Fossilized stomach contents are not restricted to carnivorous dinosaurs. Plant remains have been found inside the body cavity of hadrosaurs. The chest cavity of the Edmontosaurus mummy contains the fossil remains of conifer needles, twigs, seeds, and fruits.

Coprolites (fossilized bodily waste) yield unequivocal evidence about the dietary habits of dinosaurs, revealing both dietary diversity and specialization in plant consumption.
