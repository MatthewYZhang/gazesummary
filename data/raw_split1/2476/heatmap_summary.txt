Geographical constraints in Iran have led to nomadic pastoralism, where people move livestock, such as sheep and goats, from place to place due to sparse natural vegetation. This nomadic movement often occurred vertically, with people and animals moving from lowlands in winter to highlands in summer. The animals raised by pastoralists provided food and materials for crafts like carpets and tents. Pastoralists were typically organized into tribal confederations to control the vast territories needed for their herds.

The tribes played a significant role in Iranian history and were skilled in herding, hunting, and protecting lands and animals, which could be adapted for military purposes. Eventually, the development of underground canals known as qanats allowed for farming outside of areas with sufficient rainfall. The qanat system used the natural slope of plateau basins to transport water from a water source through a sequence of wells and shafts connected by underground canals to a suitable area for cultivation. These canals were underground to minimize evaporation, and gravity provided the means of moving the water. The total length of the qanat system is estimated to be over 300,000 kilometers.
