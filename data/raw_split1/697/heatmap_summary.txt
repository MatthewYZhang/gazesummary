Pollen, a powdery substance produced by flowering plants, is carried by insects or birds in most plants, but some plants rely on the wind. Wind pollination, surprisingly common, is excellent for moving pollen long distances. However, wind is unspecific, making it similar to throwing letters into the air hoping one reaches a friend, which works for abundant species in temperate forests but not in the tropics. Wind-pollinated flowers, dispensing with attracting agents like petals and scents, have insignificant-looking flowers and catkins. Deciduous wind-pollinated trees shed leaves in fall and produce pollen in spring when branches are bare, while evergreens flower in autumn or winter. Pollen produced high in branches is blown farther when the wind is strong enough to bend catkins. The fates of windborne pollen depend on weather and other conditions. However, windborne pollen is dry, rounded, smooth, and smaller than that of insect-pollinated plants. Small grains can be blown farther, but these particles are prone to be whisked past the waiting stigma. Stigmas create turbulence, which slows the air speed around them.
