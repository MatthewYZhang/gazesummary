The Earth's deep interior can be studied by analyzing seismic waves produced by earthquakes. Seismic waves, including primary (P-waves) and secondary (S-waves), pass through Earth and are the most informative. Changes in seismic wave properties reveal Earth's division into a core, mantle, and crust, with sudden velocity and angle shifts indicating discontinuities, such as the Gutenberg discontinuity.

The Gutenberg discontinuity, located at 2,900 kilometers, marks the outer boundary of the Earth's core. At this depth, S-waves cannot propagate due to their inability to travel through fluids, leading geophysicists to believe that the outer core is fluid. While P-waves can pass through liquids, they slow down and refract downward upon entering the molten outer core. The radius of the core is approximately 3,500 kilometers, with a solid inner core of about 1,220 kilometers.

Earth's density is 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter, but the density of surface rocks is less than 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter, indicating high-density materials in the deep interior, like iron mixed with nickel, under extreme pressure conditions. The presence of iron meteorites suggests the Earth has an iron-nickel core. A magnetic field is developed by the flow of electric charges and requires good electrical conductors. Heat-driven movements in the outer core, coupled with movements induced by Earth's spin, are thought to provide the necessary flow of electrons around the inner core that produces the magnetic field. Without a metallic core, Earth's magnetic field would not be possible.
