Thermoregulation is the process by which mammals and birds maintain a stable internal body temperature, generally warmer than their surroundings. Counteracting constant heat loss is achieved through several key adaptations. The primary mechanism is endothermy's high metabolic rate, which allows endotherms to produce substantial metabolic heat to compensate for heat flow to the environment and adjust heat production to changing rates of heat loss. Muscle activity like moving or shivering can increase heat production. Some mammals have certain hormones that enable mitochondria to raise metabolic activity and generate heat instead of ATP, a process called nonshivering thermogenesis, or NST. NST occurs throughout the body, with brown fat in the neck and shoulders being specialized for rapid heat production. Mammals and birds in cold climates can significantly boost their metabolic heat production through shivering and NST. Insulation, such as hair, feathers, and fat layers, is another important adaptation that reduces heat flow and lowers the energy needed to stay warm. Mammals and birds raise their fur or feathers to trap a thicker layer of air in cold environments. Vasodilation and vasoconstriction regulate heat exchange and can cause regional temperature variations. Marine mammals have insulating fat called blubber beneath the skin to survive in freezing polar seas. However, when it comes to overheating, vasodilation of blood vessels in the skin removes heat. Finally, evaporative cooling is important in dissipating body heat.
