The age of planets and the universe can be estimated in different ways. The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun in the same direction and plane, suggesting they formed together from a rotating disk. Precisely determining when the planets formed is a challenge due to Earth's rapid erosion, which is caused by water abundance and continuous alteration of the crust through volcanic and metamorphic processes. Geologists look to meteorites to date Earth's origin, which appear to represent primitive solar system material. Meteorites have been radiometrically dated, clustering around 4.6 billion years. This age is similar to that of Moon rocks. Unlike Earth, the Moon's surface lacks water and strong crust movements. The evidence that the universe is expanding makes it possible to estimate its age. Light waves that reach Earth from distant galaxies have larger redshifts than those from nearby galaxies. This shift, known as redshift, is caused by the expansion of space between galaxies, stretching light waves. Calculations based on these redshifts indicate that about 13.7 billion years ago all of the galaxies would have been at one spot, the site of the big bang.
