Between 9,000 and 4,000 years ago, Mexico was mainly inhabited by hunter-foragers in small bands, moving seasonally to exploit resources. These bands had a low environmental impact due to their small size and mobility. A few groups along the lake margins in the Valley of Mexico and coasts were sedentary villagers, but their role in plant and animal domestication is unclear. Around 4,000 years ago, maize cob size increased, enabling people in the Mexican highlands to subsist mainly on maize.

The Olmec emerged in the South Gulf Coast of Mexico around 1000 B.C., constructing massive clay pyramids and platforms, living in larger groups, farming intensively, and producing notable stone sculptures. The Olmec's name comes from an ancient American word for rubber, reflecting the region's rubber trees. Some believe the Olmec culture was the mother culture of later Mesoamerican societies, influencing them through military, political, religious, or economic means. However, others argue the Olmec were just one of several independent cases of social complexity evolution in Mesoamerica.
