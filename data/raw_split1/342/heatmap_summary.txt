Agriculture developed independently in various regions with populations possessing knowledge of plants and animals. Transitioning from hunting and gathering to agriculture had drawbacks, including forced sedentarism and the need for storage and irrigation. The health of agriculturalists was worse than that of hunter-gatherers. A traditional view held that agriculture arose from a global population crisis, but this is considered unlikely because hunter-gatherer societies can control their population. Climate changes 13,000 years ago led to a population growth due to resource abundance. However, unstable climatic conditions prompted nomadic populations to settle, leading to population growth and increased food demand, thus leading to agriculture. Archaeologist Steven Mithen argues that cognitive fluidity, developed around 40,000 years ago, enabled humans to find solutions to economic crises like the farming dilemma. Mithen proposes four mental elements: the ability to develop tools, use plants and animals for social prestige, develop relationships with animals, and manipulate plants and animals. Some societies domesticated animals and plants but remained illiterate, while others avoided agriculture despite knowing about it.
