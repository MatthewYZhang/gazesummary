After the Roman conquest of Britain in the first century A.D., the presence of administrators, merchants, and troops on British soil, along with the flow of ideas and goods, greatly influenced life in the British Isles through objects, craft workers, and architecture. Utilitarian items like clothing and utensils gained social status, and the flooding of Britain with red-gloss pottery from Gaul, decorated with Classical mythology, introduced Greco-Roman styles. Mass-produced goods and statuettes were acquired by native leaders, creating a widespread fashion. Some natives bought the whole package of Roman culture, like the Fishbourne villa, built in the Italian style for King Cogidubnus, which was furnished with imported marbles and sculptures, demonstrating how cultural symbols bound provincials to the Roman world. The influx of craft workers, especially in stone-carving, was significant, and the temple at Bath was carved by artists from Gaul, highlighting the role of administrators in connecting Britons with architects and masons. Moreover, Roman architecture impacted native people by its grand scale and dominance, contrasting with the rounded shapes of native buildings and reflecting imperial power.
