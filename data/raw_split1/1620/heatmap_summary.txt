Communication technology influences how we think about the world, changing the subjects we consider, the symbols used to communicate ideas, and the environments in which our thoughts evolve. In the history of communication, the printing press of the fifteenth century and electronic media of the nineteenth century stand out as revolutionary technologies.

The nineteenth century saw the advent of electronic media, marking another significant revolution in communication technology. The telegraph, invented in 1843, inaugurated the electronic era by using electrical signals to transmit information, setting the stage for technologies such as the telephone in 1876, the phonograph in 1878, film and movies in the 1890s, radio in 1919, and television in 1925.

The emergence of electronic media brought about the most significant transformation in communication since the invention of writing. Its rapid spread intensified commercial and social interactions, fundamentally altering how people received information and understood the world. The authentic nature of ideas conveyed through voices or pictures surpassed that of the printed word, enhancing the perception that what was broadcasted was necessarily true.
