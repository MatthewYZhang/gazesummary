The climate of Japan is largely determined by two major climatic forces. Prevailing westerly winds sweep over the islands eastward. Great cyclonic airflows move in a wheel-like fashion northeastward across Japan. During winter, masses of cold air from Siberia dominate the weather and cold winds skim across the Sea of Japan, depositing snow on the western side of Honshu Island. These cold air masses then flow down eastern slopes, bringing cold, relatively dry weather.

In spring, the Siberian air mass warms and loses density, directing warmer air over the Pacific into northeast Asia. This warm, moisture-laden air covers southern Japan during June and July, resulting in late spring rains that give way to a drier summer which is sufficiently hot and muggy.

The island chain's mountains backbone and great length from north to south produce climatic diversity that has contributed to regional differences. Along the Sea of Japan, cold, snowy winters have discouraged settlement.

Summer weather patterns in northern Honshu, especially along the Sea of Japan, have discouraged agriculture due to the yamase effect, which lowers temperatures and damages farm production, particularly impacting rice cultivation. The yamase effect does not extend far south.
