Motion pictures and television are possible because of two quirks of the human perceptual system, namely the phi phenomenon and persistence of vision. The phi phenomenon refers to the perception of continuous movement when one light source goes out while another close one is illuminated. Persistence of vision is where our eyes continue to see an image for a spit second after it has disappeared. This was first observed by the ancient Greeks.

In 1878, Edward Muybridge, attempted to settle a $25.000 bet over whether the four feet of a galloping horse ever simultaneously left the ground. The rapid viewing of the series of pictures produced an effect much like that of a motion picture. Instead of 24 cameras taking one pictures in rapid order, it was Thomas Edison and his assistant, William Dickson, who finally developed what might have been the first practical motion-picture camera and viewing device.

In 1894, Kinetoscope parlors were spring up in major cities. The long-range commercial potential of his invention was lost on Edison. Public interest was soon rekindled when early filmmakers discovered that movies could be used to tell story.  In France, Alice Guy-Blach√® produced The Cabbage Fairy.
