At the end of the Ice Age, only a few thousand foragers lived along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the Jordan and Euphrates valleys, but within 2,000 years, the human population of the region increased to tens of thousands due to village life and farming. Environmental and archaeological discoveries have revealed details about this shift. Climatic changes in southwestern Asia involved shifts in mountain snow lines, rainfall patterns, and vegetation cover, which had major impacts on the sparse human populations.

The universal global warming at the end of the Ice Age had dramatic effects on temperate regions. Pollen samples indicate that forest cover expanded rapidly at the end of the Ice Age, as southwestern Asia was cooler and wetter. Many areas were rich in animal and plant species, favoring human occupation. Around 9000 B.C., settlements were along the Mediterranean coast and in the Zagros Mountains. The inhabitants of Abu Hureyra in Syria's Euphrates valley subsisted off spring migrations of Persian gazelles. About 300 to 400 people lived in a sizable, permanent settlement.
