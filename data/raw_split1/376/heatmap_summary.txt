In the seventeenth century, Dutch agriculture and fishing formed the primary sector of the economy. Dutch agriculture modernized, commercialized new crops, and used new agricultural techniques to increase production, which aligned with market demands. The Dutch imported cheap grain from the Baltic region annually, and approximately 120,000 tons of imported grain fed about a third of the Dutch population. Importing grain kept its price low, stimulating demand for other foodstuffs and consumer goods.

The ability to reduce labor-intensive grain production allowed the land and workforce to be used for more productive agricultural divisions. The peasants specialized in livestock husbandry and dairy farming, and grew industrial and fodder crops like flax, madder, rape, tobacco, hops, and turnips. These products were mostly bought by urban businesses.

As demand for agricultural produce from consumers and industry increased, agricultural land became more valuable, leading people to work the available land more intensively and reclaim more land from wetlands and lakes. Peasants increased production by utilizing crop rotation and applying animal waste to the soil. Industrial waste, such as ash from soap-boilers, was collected and sold as artificial fertilizer, and the increased yield and price of land justified reclaiming and draining even more land.
