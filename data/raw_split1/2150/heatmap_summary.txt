Wind pollination involves plants relying on the wind to carry pollen, which is often seen as primitive and wasteful. It is surprisingly common, especially in higher latitudes, where pollen can be blown for hundreds of kilometers. The drawback is that wind is unspecific, like trying to get a letter to a friend by throwing letters into the air. However, for dominant tree species in temperate forests, this is a safe gamble, while in the tropics, animals are a safer bet.

Wind-pollinated flowers do not need to attract insects, so they lack bright petals, nectar, and scent, resulting in insignificant-looking flowers and catkins. Adaptations help pollen go as far as possible. Deciduous wind-pollinated trees produce pollen in the spring with bare branches, while evergreen conifers flower in autumn or winter. Pollen produced higher in the top branches is likely to go farther. Dangling catkins hold pollen until the wind is strong. Pollen is shed primarily when the air is dry.

Windborne pollen is dry, rounded, smooth, and generally smaller than that of insect-pollinated plants. Small grains may be blown farther but are also prone to be whisked past the waiting stigma.
