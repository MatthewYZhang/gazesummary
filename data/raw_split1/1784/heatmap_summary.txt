The round arch was used by the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia but was fully developed by the Romans. The arch enables the architect to open up large spaces in a wall without risking the building's structural soundness. As utilized by the Romans, the arch is a perfect semicircle. The arch is constructed from wedge-shaped pieces of stone that meet at an angle always perpendicular to the curve of the arch and stable when it is complete. An arch under construction must be supported from below.

The Pont du Gard, an elegant Roman structure, functioned as an aqueduct and exemplifies the best qualities of arch construction. When many arches are placed one behind the other, the result is called a barrel vault, which makes it possible to create large interior spaces. The finest expression can be found in churches of the Middle Ages. An example is the church of Sainte-Foy. Builders set a stone barrel vault as a ceiling over the nave, unifying the interior visually.

While the round arch and vault of the Romanesque era solved many problems, they had drawbacks. The Gothic period in Europe solved these problems with the pointed arch, which offers many advantages. Weight is channeled down to the ground at a steeper angle, and the vault can be much taller than a barrel vault.
