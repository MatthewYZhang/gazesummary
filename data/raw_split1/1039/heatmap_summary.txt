Group decision-making offers several advantages. Committees, task forces, and ad hoc groups can focus the experience and expertise of several people on a particular problem or situation. A group offers greater total knowledge, accumulating more information, knowledge, and facts than individuals. Each person in the group can draw on their unique education, experience, insights, and resources. Varied backgrounds and expertise help overcome tunnel vision.

Participation in group decision-making leads to higher member satisfaction. People accept decisions more readily when they have participated in making them, leading to greater understanding, commitment, and successful implementation. A disadvantage of group decision making is the time required, which can be costly. Group decisions should be avoided when speed and efficiency are primary. Group discussion may be dominated by an individual, stifling other members' participation. Members may prioritize personal goals over group goals, leading to arguments and compromised decisions. Groups may exert social pressure, leading to groupthink.

Groupthink is an agreement-at-any-cost mentality resulting in ineffective decision making when groups are cohesive, have directive leaders, and lack objective information. This fosters the illusion of invulnerability, leading to decisions made without considering alternatives. Recent research suggests groupthink can also result from preconceived ideas, limiting the examination of decision alternatives.
