Noisy begging by nestling songbirds can attract predators, like hawks or raccoons, potentially leading to the death of the defenseless nestlings. A study using tapes of begging tree swallows played at artificial nests showed that eggs in noisy nests were more likely to be destroyed by predators. Warbler species nesting on the ground produce higher-frequency begging calls that do not travel as far, concealing them from predators, while eggs advertised by tree-nesting warblers were found bitten more often.

Begging calls have evolved properties to reduce the risk of attracting predators. The hypothesis is that baby birds with high rates of nest predation should produce softer begging signals of higher frequency. One possibility is that a noisy baby bird provides accurate signals of its real hunger and good health, making it worthwhile for the listening parent to give it food.

Experiments show that begging provides a signal of need. However, begging louder isn't always advantageous due to the damage caused to siblings who share genes. Therefore, a begging nestling securing food at the expense of siblings might leave behind fewer copies of its genes overall.
