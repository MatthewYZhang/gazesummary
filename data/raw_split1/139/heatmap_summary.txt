The Hawaiian Islands, formed by volcanoes about five million years ago and isolated from other landmasses, experienced a softening of their harsh, barren surfaces due to the alternating conditions of sunshine and rain. Winds played a role in bringing life-forms to the islands.

Spores, light enough to be carried by the wind from ancient lands, landed randomly across the mountain flanks. Lichens, a symbiotic combination of algae and fungus, are considered to be the first successful flora. Algae use photosynthesis to capture energy, storing it in organic molecules. The fungi absorb moisture and mineral salts from the rocks, passing on waste products that nourish algae. The earliest living things that built communities are examples of symbiosis.

After ferns evolved, another kind of flora evolved: the seed-bearing plants. The seed has an outer coating that surrounds the genetic material of the new plant, and inside this covering is a concentrated supply of nutrients. One type of seed-bearing plant, the angiosperm, includes all forms of blooming vegetation.
