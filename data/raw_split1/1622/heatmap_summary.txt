The five-seven shift is a major change in children between five and seven, where simpler learning gives way to complex mental processes. This shift involves biological growth in the brain and stabilization of brain-wave rhythms. Psychologist Jean Piaget views this period as a transition to operational thought, enabling children to move beyond senses to rational-thinking skills.

By five, children understand and use symbols like words and gestures, and they are able to focus on only one quality of an object at a time. Symbolization continues to evolve, peaking around seven or eight when children can perform concrete operations. They can then solve problems using rational thought and make generalizations. Piaget discovered that children at this stage develop an understanding of conservation, where properties stay the same despite changes in appearance. In an experiment, children are shown two rows of coins, and younger children believe that a spread-out row has more coins, while older children understand that both rows have the same amount. The experimenter pours water from one of these glasses into a tall, thin glass. When asked why they think that, many will confidently say, “Because it’s taller.” Older children, however, are likely to reply, “It looks like there’s more water in this one because it’s taller, but they’re really the same.” Older children can solve the task easily.
