Beginning in the 1160s, new silver mines in northern Europe led to the minting of silver coins. The use of cash increased international trade. Individual traveling merchants evolved into operations with three types of merchants: sedentary merchants who ran the "home office", carriers who transported goods, and company agents resident abroad. The sedentary merchant financed and organized the firm's entire export-import trade. Carriers transported goods by land and sea. Company agents resident in cities abroad looked after sales and procurements. Also, regular courier service among commercial cities began, and commercial accounting became more complex. The German Hanseatic League illustrates these advancements. It was a mercantile association of European towns dating from 1159 that grew to include about 200 cities. The commercial revolution also provided the opportunity for thousands of agricultural workers to improve their social position.
