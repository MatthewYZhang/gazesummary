Before the nineteenth century, tall buildings relied on load-bearing masonry walls, which needed to be thick, especially at the base. These walls supported the building's significant weight, with stoneworkers placing stone or brick upon stone and adding mortar for stability. Wooden beams supported floors and roofs. In the 1850s, metal construction emerged as an alternative to eliminate the need for exterior weight-bearing walls, utilizing a three-dimensional grid of metal beams and columns. This innovation allowed for larger interior spaces with fewer columns. The new construction was capable of supporting all loads, including vertical forces from the weight of floors and horizontal forces from wind or earthquakes. Iron-framed buildings marked a departure from the load-bearing wall tradition, with wrought iron shaped by hammering or rolling. These modifications led to sturdier, lighter, taller buildings known as skyscrapers. Skyscrapers utilized technical innovations like cast iron and the elevator. Cast iron technology made modern plumbing possible, and the invention of the mechanical elevator allowed for even taller buildings. Steel became significant as it replaced iron, being lighter and stronger. Steel rivets replaced iron bolts, and exterior curtain walls became thinner.
