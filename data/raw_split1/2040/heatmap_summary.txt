Between 1450 and 1575, Industrial output in Europe increased substantially, with domestic European factors being the primary drivers. The population increased from 61 million in 1500 to 78 million a century later, with a higher percentage residing in cities and relying on markets. Europeans' incomes also rose. Urban groups, farmers benefiting from higher prices, and landlords collecting rents experienced significant gains. Government efforts in state-building stimulated industries like shipbuilding, textiles, and metallurgy. France developed its iron industry due to the Hapsburgs dominating weapon manufacturing. New commodities became available like knitted stockings, ribbon and lace, buttons, starch, soap, vinegar brewed from beer, knives and tools, pots and ovens, goods formerly made only for local sale, now entered into channels of national or international trade. The printing industry advanced rapidly after Gutenberg's innovation in 1453. Transaction costs decreased due to improved security, larger urban populations, transport innovations like the carrack, and more efficient organizational forms, alongside falling interest rates.
