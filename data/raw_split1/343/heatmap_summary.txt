Autobiographical memory is memory for events that have occurred in one's own life. Most people find it hard to recall memories for experiences prior to age three, this phenomenon is called infantile amnesia. One idea that tries to explain why this happens is based on Jean Piaget's work. Children under age two represent events differently from older children. As verbal abilities emerge around age two, they allow events to be coded in a different way than the action-based codes of infants. 

Another idea is that children need to understand themselves as a psychological entity before they can talk about past events. The development of self-understanding occurs between the first and second years of life. Also, children need to understand the general form stories take. The social experiences children have do factor into the development of autobiographical memories. A final thought is that children must develop a "theory of mind" before they can talk about past memories. Talking with parents about the past helps the child understand what it means to remember.
