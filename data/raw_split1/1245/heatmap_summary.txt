In the eleventh century, Europe underwent significant social, technological, and economic changes, resulting in two distinct regions. Northern Europe developed as a hierarchical society based on land ownership, whereas the Mediterranean south was more fluid, with industry and commerce influencing social status. Individual and social identity in the north were established on a personal basis, while in the south, they were established on a civic basis. By the twelfth century, the north and south were very different places.

Political dominance resided in the north, with Germany, France, and England possessing large populations and armies. Feudalism organized these kingdoms into powerful states. Southern Europe, however, led in economic and cultural life, with the Italian city of Palermo generating more commercial tax revenue than the entire kingdom of England. Southern communities had urbane, multilingual cultures, making them the intellectual and artistic leaders of the age, and literacy rates in the south surpassed those of the north.

The continual effort by the northern kingdoms to extend their control southward was a central theme of political history. However, cultural norms and social mechanisms also expanded northward, and the relationship of north and south was symbiotic.
