In the fourteenth century, political developments disrupted Europe's overland trade routes to southern and eastern Asia, prompting a desire for direct sea trade with the East due to the European economy's decline. Accounts by Marco Polo emphasized the wealth to be gained from trading with China, making the idea of sea trade irresistible, especially since traditional land routes were no longer viable. The main challenge was technological, requiring new ships and navigation methods for vast oceans instead of the familiar Mediterranean and Baltic seas.

Spices were highly desired commodities, improving European cuisine, perfumes, and medicines, but they required large-scale transport to justify the expense of sailing around Africa to India and China. Initially, the galley, a long, low ship with sails and oars, was unsuitable for ocean voyages due to its instability. However, around 1400, the caravel was developed with a wider, deeper hull and multiple masts, making it more stable and capable of carrying more cargo. The astrolabe, used since the eleventh century, measured the height of the Sun and stars to determine latitude, while the magnetic compass, developed by the thirteenth century, aided navigation in cloudy conditions. By 1400, key elements were in place for Europe to begin its sea exploration, including institutional norms like the Consulate of the Sea, which defined maritime conduct and authority.
