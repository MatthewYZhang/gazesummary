The Norse were the first Europeans to venture to North America, and the Icelandic sagas document these voyages. These sagas recount the voyages of Leif Eriksson and his brother Thorvald, who were blown off course from Norway to Greenland. The sagas also describe Thorfinn Karlsefni's efforts to colonize a place called Vinland. Bjarni Herjolfsson, another Norseman, also discovered a wooded coastline and was the first European to see North America. 

Leif Eriksson, encouraged by Herjolfsson's report, explored southwards and discovered Stoneland, likely the Labrador coast. He later discovered Vinland and spent a winter there. Thorfinn Karlsefni led another expedition to Vinland around 1004 with the intent to stay longer, bringing women and cattle. Karlsefni and his group lived in Vinland for two years and fought with the local aboriginal tribes, referred to as "skrelings." Despite the initial colonization efforts and continued occasional visits, the Greenlanders ultimately departed.

In the 20th century, Helge Ingstad found evidence of Vinland, in the form of sod huts and Norse artifacts. Ingstad excavated the remains of eight sod huts, along with artifacts of Norse origin like a bronze pin and sewing tools. He concluded that the grassland called L'Anse aux Meadows was at least a Norse settlement. These sod huts were found to be substantial enough for permanent occupation.
