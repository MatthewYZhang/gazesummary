The trickster figure in mythology is a character that breaks the rules of the gods or nature. Often malicious, the trickster is usually a male figure, who may disguise himself in female form, and who is cunning or foolish, and humorous. The trickster's curiosity leads him into trouble, but he rescues himself with his sly wit. He performs important cultural tasks that benefit humans, and he is a significant figure in world mythology. Prometheus steals fire from the gods and gives it to humans and Coyote also steals fire from the gods, but Coyote is usually more of a jokester or a prankster than an intellectual. The trickster is both creator and destroyer, and according to psychologist Carl Jung, the trickster is “a primitive cosmic being of divine-animal nature, on the one hand superior to man because of his superhuman qualities, and on the other hand inferior to him because of his unreason and unconsciousness.” Coyote teaches through negative example by employing the human vices of lying, cheating, and stealing.
