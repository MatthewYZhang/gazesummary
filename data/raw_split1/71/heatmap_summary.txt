The Cambrian explosion, a rapid diversification of animals, occurred during a geologically brief period. Scientists have questioned why it happened so late in Earth's history and why the fossil record doesn't fully document the evolutionary changes. One interpretation is that early animals were soft-bodied and less likely to fossilize. Conditions that promote fossilization include rapid covering by sediments. Three fossil formations, the Ediacara, the Tommotian, and the Burgess Shale provide insights into this period. The Burgess Shale, located in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, contains both soft and hard-bodied animals that were rapidly buried by mud slides. This formation reveals about 32 modern animal groups and 20 unique body forms that cannot be assigned to any modern animals, including Anomalocaris and Wiwaxia, along with extinct representatives of modern animal groups like Sidneyia. The Cambrian explosion involved rapid evolutionary diversification followed by extinction. The reasons for this rapid evolution remain unknown, but many zoologists believe it was due to the availability of ecological niches with little competition.
