Nineteen-century politics in the United States saw the rise of Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party, marking the beginning of the modern presidency. Jackson expanded the power of the presidency, asserting that the President is the direct representative of the American people.

Jackson's opponents formed the Whig party, with Whigs and Democrats holding different attitudes toward the changes brought about by the market. The Democrats viewed society as a conflict between "the people" and greedy aristocrats, claiming that the "paper money aristocracy" manipulated the banking system for profit. They sought the rewards of the market without sacrificing the agrarian republic, rejecting the complex dealing.

In contrast, the Whigs were more comfortable with the market, considering commerce and economic development agents of civilization. They did not envision a conflict between farmers, workers, businesspeople, and bankers, believing that economic growth would benefit everyone.

Both parties had to have significant support among farmers and workers to win votes. The Whigs enjoyed disproportionate strength among the business and commercial classes, while Democrats attracted farmers isolated from the market. The Whigs were strongest in towns and cities, while Democrats dominated areas of semisubsistence farming.
