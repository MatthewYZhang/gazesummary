The transition from forest to treeless tundra on a mountain slope is often dramatic, occurring within a few tens of meters. This transition zone is known as the upper timberline or tree line, with a lower timberline also present in semiarid areas due to a lack of moisture. The upper timberline is highest in the tropics and lowest in the Polar Regions, ranging from sea level to 4,500 meters depending on the climate. Timberline trees are usually evergreens, though broadleaf deciduous trees can form the timberline, such as birch in the Himalayas.

At the upper timberline, trees become twisted and deformed, influenced by snow cover duration and depth in middle and upper latitudes. In the tropics, valleys are more favorable for tree growth due to less frost and deeper soils. Factors like browsing and grazing by animals, as well as temperature, can contribute to this limit. The tundra consists of low-lying shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Higher up, the number and diversity of species decrease, leading to bare ground with mosses, lichens, and cushion plants. The highest plants in the world occur at 6,100 meters in the Himalayas, where rocks warmed by the sun melt snowdrifts.
