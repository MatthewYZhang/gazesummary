The westward movement of population in the United States is closely tied to the expansion of American agriculture and the development of new areas for raising livestock and cultivating crops like wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton. Improved transportation after 1815 allowed western farmers to participate in the national market economy, with westward migration increasing during periods of high commodity prices. Between 1810 and 1840, the percentage of the American population living west of the Appalachian Mountains increased substantially.

European ancestors were often driven to America due to religious, political, or economic crises, and this break from their roots contributed to their restless nature. American society, with its less rigid class structure, encouraged people to improve their social and economic standing. Social traits helped to produce the nomadic and daring settlers who kept pushing westward beyond the fringes of settlement.

The construction of turnpikes improved western transportation, reducing costs and stimulating the commercialization of agriculture. Further advancements, such as the steamboat and the Erie Canal, revolutionized transportation, leading to increased regional specialization and the growth of a national market economy. The cost of freight transportation significantly decreased with these developments.
