The planets in our solar system revolve around the Sun in the same direction and in nearly the same plane, indicating they formed simultaneously from a rotating disk. Precisely dating the planets is difficult due to Earth's erosion. Geologists look beyond Earth and use meteorites, which represent primitive solar system material, for dating.

Some meteorites are stony, iron, or stony-iron, and originate as extraterrestrial objects called meteors. Many meteorites are fragments of larger bodies broken by collisions. Iron meteorites come from the interiors, comparable to Earth's core, while stony meteorites originate from outer portions, like Earth's mantle. Radiometric dating of meteorites and lunar rocks clusters around 4.6 billion years, indicating the age of the solar system. 

Determining the age of the universe is more complex. Galaxies are moving away from each other, showing the universe is expanding, which is analogous to an inflating balloon with coins attached. The expansion causes redshift in light waves, with distant galaxies showing larger redshifts. Calculations based on redshifts estimate the Big Bang occurred 13.7 billion years ago, representing the age of the universe.
