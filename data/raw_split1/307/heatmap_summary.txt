The Roman army's presence in Britain following the Roman Empire's conquest had a significant impact, especially where it remained stationed for extended periods. The introduction of military bases led to the requisition of native lands for forts and for feeding and exercising soldiers' animals. Military rule also limited opportunities for local leaders to participate in government, stunting social development and fostering disaffection. Consequently, the military had to maintain order and govern.

The Roman army brought substantial spending power, impacting local economies. A fort's large population required food and supplies, stimulating local economies. Soldiers engaged in tasks like shoemaking, building bathhouses, and digging clay, as illustrated by a tablet mentioning 343 men involved in such activities. These activities notably contributed to infrastructure development, such as road construction. The army also provided avenues for personal advancement for native auxiliary soldiers, who obtained Roman citizenship upon retirement. Recruitment in Britain was large-scale, involving at least 12,500 men during Emperor Hadrian's reign. However, many young men were removed from their areas, and regiments were transferred to other provinces.
