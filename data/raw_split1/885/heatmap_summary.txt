The Ogallala Aquifer, a vast sandstone formation underlying 583,000 square kilometers from northwestern Texas to South Dakota, has been a crucial resource for the High Plains since the 1880s. Farmers and ranchers settled the region and benefited from the low-intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth century, the discovery of the aquifer, named after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, led to its extensive use. Water accumulated over 30,000 years.

The first wells were drilled in the 1930s, and the subsequent expansion of irrigation, particularly after the 1950s, revolutionized the region's economy. Over 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala, supporting large-scale cultivation of crops like cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn. This development, combined with the negligible natural recharge rate of the aquifer, has caused drastic declines in water tables. Wells that once reached water at 15 meters now require depths of 45 to 60 meters, with water tables dropping a meter annually. The depletion issue has prompted varied reactions from farmers. Some are attempting water conservation through less frequent irrigation and crop switching, while others are using the water while profitable and concentrating on high-value crops like cotton. With the decline in the Ogallala Aquifer, scientists have begun researching solutions such as transporting water via canal or pipeline, though the cost is high.
