In 1977, ecologists Stephen Hubbell and Leslie Johnson studied stingless bees in Costa Rica, noting social interactions influencing spacing in populations. Stingless bees, common in tropical and subtropical regions, gather nectar and pollen from diverse flowers. They typically nest in trees, forming colonies with hundreds to thousands of workers. Hubbell and Johnson found that some stingless bee species show aggression towards their species from other colonies, while others don't. Aggressive bees often forage in groups on high-density flowers, while nonaggressive bees feed individually or in small groups on dispersed flowers.

Hubbell and Johnson examined how bee behavior affects colony distributions, acknowledging the impact of available nesting sites. Mapping suitable nest trees, they discovered a random distribution and a higher number of potential sites than bee colonies.  Hubbell and Johnson observed battles between workers from two colonies, involving displays, aerial fights, and grapples. The conflicts occurred over the possession of potential nesting sites. Fights over occupied nests can be deadly, sometimes resulting in over 1,000 bee deaths in a single battle.
