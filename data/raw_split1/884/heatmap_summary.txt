Ecosystems exhibit long-term stability where plant communities assemble themselves flexibly, depending on an area's history. Succession refers to changes in plant communities and ecosystems over time, with pioneer communities being the first and climax communities being the long-lived at the end. Pioneer and successional communities change over periods from 1 to 500 years. An ecologist studying a pond may find it unchanged in a year, with individual fish replaced but the number remaining constant. Properties of an ecosystem are therefore more stable than the individual organisms composing it. Ecologists believed that species diversity made ecosystems stable, noting long-lasting climax communities with complex food webs and species diversity, while farmlands dominated by a single crop are unstable. However, resilience of communities is especially important because climax communities are being severely damaged, and it's crucial to understand what contributes to a community's resistance to destruction and its recovery. The relative long-term stability of climax communities comes not from diversity but from the "patchiness" of the environment, and local populations can be replaced by immigrants.
