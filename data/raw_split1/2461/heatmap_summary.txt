North Americans have historically viewed their continent's natural environment differently. These visions have shifted from early settlement to the Civil War, with different peoples reshaping the land based on their perspectives of nature. Consequences of changes range from deliberate acts like cutting forests to unintended results like mining and dam building. Native peoples also reshaped the environment.

Long before European settlers, native peoples had agricultural practices that changed the land. They cleared space for gardens by selectively killing trees. Native American visions featured people living in harmony with nature and celebrating its riches through rituals. The first English immigrants described the countryside as wooded, but with large, well-spaced trees.

In contrast, European colonists viewed the land as a "howling wilderness." They brought agricultural practices from England, seeing uncultivated lands as "wastes" needing to be improved. Transplanted English settlers attempted to subdue the wilderness by mapping, draining, clearing, fencing, and planting crops. However, despite efforts to control nature, settlers failed to gain mastery. Rivers often reminded them of natureâ€™s unpredictability and power. Only later did colonists begin to see nature as useful.
