Cetaceans, including whales, dolphins, and porpoises, are often considered highly intelligent. Dolphins, killer whales, and pilot whales can quickly learn tricks in captivity, and the military has trained bottlenose dolphins for tasks like finding bombs and working as underwater spies. Dolphins also exhibit observational learning and imitation, such as mimicking a diver cleaning a window.

Comparisons between cetacean and human intelligence are often made, with some studies placing dolphin intelligence somewhere between that of a dog and a chimpanzee. However, intelligence is a human construct, and cetaceans should not be judged solely by their problem-solving abilities. While both humans and cetaceans have large brains with a cortex, cetaceans primarily process information related to hearing and sound, while humans rely more on vision. Despite lacking vocal cords, dolphins can produce sounds similar to human speech through their blowholes.

Captive bottlenose dolphins have been taught American Sign Language, communicating with trainers and demonstrating the ability to differentiate commands based on word order. However, they do not appear to possess a language as complex as humans. Wild bottlenose dolphins in Australia have been observed using sponges as tools for protection while foraging for food. Some researchers prefer to focus on cetaceans' "awareness" rather than intelligence, acknowledging their unique perception of the environment.
