The creation of life necessitates a collection of chemical elements to form cellular components, with life on Earth utilizing approximately 25 of the 92 naturally occurring elements, with oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen comprising approximately 96 percent of living organisms. Scientists have determined that nearly all chemical elements in the universe, with the exception of hydrogen and helium, were produced by stars. These heavy elements, though rare, are found nearly everywhere. Heavy elements are produced by stars and released into space by stellar deaths, so their amount compared to hydrogen and helium gradually rises with time.

Planetesimals everywhere should contain the elements needed for life, which means that objects built from planetesimals also contain these elements. However, we cannot absolutely rule out the possibility of life with another chemical basis, but the elements are still products of stars and would still be present in planetesimals everywhere. No matter what kinds of life we are looking for, we are likely to find the necessary elements on almost every planet, moon, asteroid, and comet in the universe.
