The earliest-known horse fossils, Eohippus, date back to the Eocene epoch, and were initially not recognized as related to modern horses. Eohippus was tiny, about the size of a small dog, and lived in wooded areas. Unlike modern horses, Eohippus had four hoofed toes on the front feet and three on the rear. These animals had hooves but they had four hoofed toes on the front feet, three on the rear, and the hooves were padded. It was herbivorous (plant eating) and had canine teeth.

Miocene horses developed teeth with more elaborate and resistant grinding surfaces and larger crowns because grasses are abrasive and difficult to chew. This meant that the head had to be deeper, and the muzzle longer. The legs and feet became better adapted to rapid running through fusion in the lower parts of the legs, with an emphasis on the central hoofed toe.

By the Pleistocene epoch, the modern horse genus, Equus, had spread across the world. Horses then inexplicably disappeared from North America, later to be reintroduced by early Spanish explorers.
