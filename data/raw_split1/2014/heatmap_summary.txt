Many believe that social creatures are more evolved and leave more offspring than solitary animals. However, social and solitary types compete to determine who leaves more offspring. In some species, social individuals win, but in most, solitary types leave more surviving descendants. Under certain conditions, a cost-benefit analysis favors solitary life. Social animals expend time and energy competing for status, and subordinates must signal submission to superiors. Social groups also offer opportunities for reproductive interference, and sociality has disadvantages like heightened competition for food and increased vulnerability to parasites and disease. Parasites and fungi can make life miserable for social creatures, but the costs of living together must be outweighed by benefits. Improved protection against predators is a widespread fitness benefit for social animals. For instance, bluegill sunfish cooperate to drive away predators. Solitary pumpkinseed sunfish are not inferior; they simply gain less through social living and have adapted solitary nesting.
