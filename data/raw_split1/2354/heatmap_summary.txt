Organisms evolve adaptations that make them dependent on each other for resources, such as mycorrhizal fungi living in tree root systems, facilitating mineral uptake while the trees photosynthesize. Intimate relationships like this are examples of coevolution. The relationship between pinyon pines and pinyon jays may not initially appear as coevolution, as pinyon pines produce cones and seeds that attract seed predators, particularly the pinyon jay. Pinyons encourage jays to visit and consume their seeds by positioning cones upward and outward, making seeds visible, and having unusually large, energy-rich seeds with thin seed coats. The seed coats also differ in color between edible and nonviable seeds, signaling the jays as to which they should select. Pinyon jays help the trees by burying any seeds in excess of their immediate survival needs. When seeds are abundant, jays can breed very early in spring, continue breeding through summer, and reenter breeding condition as early as the winter solstice.
