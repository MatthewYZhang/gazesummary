Minerals are required for plant growth and development, being absorbed from the soil along with water, even nitrogen is normally absorbed as nitrate ions. Certain soils are deficient in nutrients, such as serpentine soils lacking calcium, hindering plant life. Mineral depletion is a significant concern in modern agriculture due to harvesting interrupting nutrient recycling. Deficiencies can be detected through symptoms like chlorosis, necrosis, and anthocyanin formation. Soils are commonly deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus, leading to specific symptoms such as chlorosis and short stems for nitrogen deficiency, and stunted growth for phosphorus deficiency. Older leaves are often affected first as phosphorus is mobilized to younger tissue. Scientists use hydroponics to study nutrient deficiencies. Certain plants, known as hyperaccumulators, can concentrate minerals at high levels, potentially offering protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens. These plants can be used to clean up contaminated sites through phytoremediation, removing toxic compounds from the soil.
