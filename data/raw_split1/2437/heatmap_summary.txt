Classification schemes are used by biologists to place the vast number of organisms on Earth into natural groupings based on shared distinguishing features like anatomy, developmental stages, and biochemical similarities. Early schemes categorized organisms into plant or animal kingdoms, but later schemes recognized the unique structure of fungi and the diversity of single-celled organisms. This led to the proposal of additional kingdoms recognizing fundamental differences among plants, animals, fungi, and unicellular prokaryotes and eukaryotes, resulting in the five-kingdom scheme: Monera, Protista, Animalia, Fungi, and Plantae. The kingdom Protista, defined as comprising all single-celled eukaryotic organisms, is not a natural grouping, and scientists disagree about which organisms it should include. It is especially problematic for the algae, which have both single-celled and multicellular representatives. Some taxonomists split the multicellular algae into two kingdoms, placing the multicellular brown and red algae with the protists and the multicellular green algae into the plant kingdom. Different attempts to classify closely related organisms are good examples of how difficult it is to develop standard criteria for grouping organisms. As we refine the criteria used to classify organisms, classification schemes will change and are tentative.
