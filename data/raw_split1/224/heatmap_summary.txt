Pastoralism, a lifestyle centered on livestock, emerged in Inner Eurasia by 3000 B.C., shaping the region for millennia. The domestication of horses facilitated transportation and warfare, distinguishing Inner Eurasian pastoralism through its mobility and militaristic nature. This mobility further explains the impact of pastoral societies, which also influences the spread of Indo-European languages. Pastoralist mobility stems from their reliance on animal-based foods, necessitating larger land areas compared to agriculture. Roger Cribb observes a strong correlation between pastoralism and nomadism. Due to constant movement, nomads maintain strict portability rules, limiting material surplus accumulation and promoting self-sufficiency. While wealth and rank inequalities exist, they're generally subdued, preventing steep wealth hierarchies. Gender inequalities are also mitigated by women acquiring various skills, including military ones.
