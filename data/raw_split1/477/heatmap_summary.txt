Roman pottery is notable for its consistently high quality and practicality. The pottery is often light and smooth to the touch, yet it is also very tough. It is generally made with carefully selected and purified clay, worked to thin-walled and standardized shapes on a fast wheel and fired in a kiln (pottery oven) capable of ensuring a consistent finish. The vessels are solid, easy to handle and wash, and have regular shapes for easy stacking and storing.

In addition to its quality, the sheer quantity of Roman pottery is impressive. There is Monte Testaccio which is made up entirely of broken oil amphorae and that it contains the remains of some 53 million amphorae. Roman pottery was transported over substantial distances and was accessible to different levels of society throughout the empire.
