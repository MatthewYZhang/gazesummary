Between 1450 and 1575, industrial output increased across Europe, driven by factors within Europe. Population growth and urbanization contributed to increased demand. Rising incomes, especially among urban groups and landowners, fueled further consumption. Government activities stimulated industries like shipbuilding, textiles, and metallurgy. Migration facilitated the spread of knowledge and new trades. Cheaper ores were used and expensive wood was economized, cutting costs per ton by 20 percent.

New commodities appeared, like knitted stockings and tools, entering national and international trade. Printing with movable type, perfected by Gutenberg in 1453, spread rapidly, with hundreds of presses emerging across Europe. Technical improvements in metals and mining led to cost reductions, while other industries focused on novel products using existing technologies. Falling interest rates contributed to declining costs, as did transport innovations such as the carrack, a large ship that reduced rates for oceanborne freight.
