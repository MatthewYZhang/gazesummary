Early Saharan pastoralists adapted to a region that experienced significant climatic changes since 10,000 B.C., with semiarid grasslands and shallow freshwater lakes covering much of what is now arid plains around 6,000 B.C. The Sahara was never well-watered, leading both humans and animals to constantly move in search of food and water. Andrew Smith suggests that the small herds of Bos primigenius in the desert became smaller, more closely knit breeding units as drought took hold, and the hunters began to prevent the herd from moving from one spot to another and gained genetic control of the animals. The herders selected breeding animals to produce offspring with different horn shapes and hide colors, which are preserved in rock paintings dating back to 5,000 B.C. Around 3,500 B.C., climatic conditions deteriorated again, leading the herders to shift south, following the major river systems into savanna regions, and experimenting with summer rainfall crops.
