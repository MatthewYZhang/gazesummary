Until the second half of the nineteenth century, the concept of spontaneous generation was widely accepted. It held that some life forms could arise spontaneously from nonliving matter, with examples including the belief that toads, snakes, and mice could emerge from moist soil, flies from manure, and maggots from decaying corpses. An opponent of spontaneous generation, Francesco Redi, conducted experiments in 1668. He demonstrated that maggots did not arise spontaneously from decaying meat. Redi filled jars with decaying meat and sealed them tightly, arranging other jars similarly but left them open. He observed that maggots only appeared in the open vessels, after flies entered and laid their eggs. His work was a serious blow to spontaneous generation, but Needham found that heated nutrient fluids soon teemed with microorganisms and claimed that microbes developed spontaneously from the fluids. Spallanzani refuted this by showing that nutrient fluids heated after being sealed in a flask did not develop microbial growth. Later, Rudolf Virchow challenged spontaneous generation with biogenesis. Finally, Pasteur's experiments demonstrated that microorganisms are present in the air and can contaminate sterile solutions, but air itself does not create microbes. He showed that Pasteur's flasks with S-shaped necks did not decay and showed no signs of life, and his work provided evidence that microorganisms cannot originate from mysterious forces present in nonliving materials.
