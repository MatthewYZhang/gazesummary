In the fourteenth century, political developments disrupted Europe's overland trade routes to Asia, prompting a desire for direct sea relations with the East due to a failing European economy. Accounts from figures like Marco Polo highlighted China's willingness to trade with Europeans and the potential wealth to be gained. The technological problem was how to reach the East given Europe's maritime tradition in calmer seas. New ships and navigation methods were needed, as well as new techniques for financing this venture. Spices were a primary commodity, used not only for taste but also for perfumes and medicine, requiring transportation in bulk. The principal seagoing ship was the galley, unsuitable for ocean voyages due to its shallow hull and instability. Soon after 1400, the caravel was developed, designed for rougher waters with a wider, deeper hull. The astrolabe had long been the primary instrument for navigation, and by about 1400 the key elements were in place to enable Europe to begin its seaward adventure.
