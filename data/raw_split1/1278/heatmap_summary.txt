In the United States, railroads were important for the transportation revolution. The mid-1800s saw railroads expand in America, and cities east of the Mississippi River became connected by railroad tracks. Chicago's growth shows the impact of rail links. In 1849, Chicago was a small village, but by 1860, it became a city of 100,000, served by railroads. Farmers no longer had to ship goods down the Mississippi River to New Orleans and could ship their products directly east. Chicago replaced New Orleans as a commercial hub.

East-west rail lines stimulated the Midwest's settlement and agricultural growth. By 1860, Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin replaced other states as leaders in wheat growing. Railroads allowed farmers to speed products east, increasing farmland values and promoting settlement. Population growth in agricultural areas led to industrial development in cities such as Chicago. The Illinois Central Railroad made money not only from traffic but also from real estate.  Railroads transformed the conduct of business, shifting financing to New York City.
