Many believe social creatures are more evolved and leave more offspring, however, social and solitary types compete, with solitary types often leaving more surviving descendants. Solitary life can be superior due to the costs of social status competition, including time and energy expenditure, and signaling submissive states. Social groups also present opportunities for reproductive interference. Sociality leads to heightened competition for food and increased vulnerability to parasites and diseases. Honeybees warm their hives against fungal pathogens, but this costs time and energy for the workers. The parasites and fungi show that if sociality evolves, its costs must be outweighed by benefits. Cliff swallows may join others for foraging benefits, male penguins huddle for warmth, and lionesses fend off enemies together. A widespread benefit of social living is predator protection as shown by groups reducing risk by spotting danger sooner, or by attacking enemies in groups. Bluegill sunfish males cooperate against egg-eating catfish, however solitary pumpkinseed sunfish have evolved powerful jaws for defense. Pumpkinseed sunfish are not inferior, they simply gain less through social living.
