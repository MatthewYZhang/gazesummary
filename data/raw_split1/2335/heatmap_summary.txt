In open grasslands, a watchful grazing animal can detect a predator's presence before it gets close enough to attack. However, grazers face a disadvantage because they must lower their heads to feed, which occupies their attention for a few seconds while hunters are patient, skillful, and intensely concentrating. These seconds allow the hunter to advance and freeze, eventually getting close enough to outrun its prey. The hunt will be worthwhile because the resulting feast will be highly nutritious.

The grazers exploit the weakness of hunters attacking only one prey at a time by herding together, making it difficult for predators to choose an individual target. When a member of the herd spots trouble, it starts to move away, and other members follow, causing the entire herd to move. If the trouble is serious, the herd will run, and the individual raising the alarm warns the others. The hunter moves with the herd, watching for an individual to wander away. When that happens, the hunter tries to move between that individual and the rest of the herd, preventing it from rejoining, giving the hunter a good chance of making a kill.
