Conservation biologists are concerned about the consequences of species extinction on ecosystem stability. The loss of species can degrade an ecosystem, with the potential for a cascade of extinctions that alters the entire ecosystem. A good example is the obliteration of kelp beds after the elimination of sea otters, due to the explosion of sea urchin populations that consumed the kelp.

It is often argued that species-rich ecosystems are more stable than species-poor ones. This is because species-rich ecosystems can have more redundancy among species in terms of their nutritional roles. If a species is lost, there is a higher chance that another species will take over its role. Also, diverse ecosystems may be less likely to be invaded by new species that would disrupt the ecosystem's structure and function. 

Researchers D. Tilman and J.A. Downing found that plots with more plant species experienced a smaller reduction in biomass after a drought. Species-rich plots tend to contain drought-resistant species that thrive in dry conditions. A species-rich ecosystem may be more stable because it is more likely to have species with a wide array of responses to variable conditions such as droughts. A species-rich ecosystem is more likely to have species with similar ecological functions, so that if a species is lost from an ecosystem, another species is likely to flourish and occupy its functional role. This is also called variability in responses and functional redundancy.

However, the findings from the Minnesota grassland research have been questioned. The relationship between diversity and stability is complex and requires further field research.
