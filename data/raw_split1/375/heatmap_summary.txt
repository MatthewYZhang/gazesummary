Urban areas process mass and energy, importing water, food, and energy, and exporting sewage, solid waste, air pollutants, and transformed materials. This energy use significantly affects the urban atmosphere, notably through heat production. The heat generated by a city in winter can match or exceed the solar heat input. The heat that warms buildings eventually transfers to the surrounding air, which is quicker in poorly insulated houses. Even without industrial production, urban areas tend to be warmer than the countryside. Additional heat comes from the heat capacity of city materials like concrete and asphalt, which store solar heat during the day and release it at night. In contrast, vegetative blankets in the countryside prevent heat from easily flowing in and out of the ground. Radiant heat is trapped by building reflections and the urban dust dome, where pollutants absorb and reradiate longwave radiation back to the surface. Cities are warmer than rural areas, forming urban heat islands. The intensity depends on physical layout, population density, and activities. City surfaces and the air above them tend to be drier due to less water available for evaporation, while buildings increase friction and slow wind.
