Breathing during sleep differs significantly from wakefulness, involving changes in respiratory control. During sleep, rib cage movements decrease, emphasizing diaphragm contractions. However, the physics of lying down hinder the diaphragm due to the stomach's weight. Wakefulness features two breathing control systems: an automatic, metabolic system in the brain stem and a voluntary, behavioral system in the forebrain. The metabolic system regulates blood gases, while the voluntary system is used for speech and overrides the metabolic one, leading to irregular breathing.

During NREM sleep, breathing becomes deeper and more regular, yet the breathing rate and air exchange decrease due to exclusive metabolic control and lower oxygen use. The body is less responsive to carbon dioxide and oxygen levels. This results in brief breathing cessation when falling asleep and increased carbon dioxide levels during sleep. In all sleep phases, breathing requires twice the effort due to increased airway resistance and relaxed muscles. Finally, the coughing reflex causes breathing cessation, with severe irritation leading to arousal and resumed breathing.
