In the open sea, food availability is often region-specific or seasonal, leading to differing survival strategies. In the deep ocean, with reduced food levels, animals must maximize their energy input to survive. In the near-surface, there are many carnivores and planktonic animals that filter plankton from the water using specialized structures. These filter-feeders thrive due to an abundance of small organisms. Fishes can also be filter-feeders, with sardines and anchovies filtering phytoplankton in productive areas. Baleen whales and whale sharks also filter-feed in coastal and polar waters.

Filtering seawater is energy-intensive, needing a specific particulate organic matter level for a net energy gain. Deep-sea organic matter levels are often low, leading to starvation conditions for filter-feeders. Consequently, there are fewer filter-feeders in deep water. Some deep-sea filter-feeders have larger filtering systems or forage in concentrated particle layers. Many shallow-water filter-feeders have predatory deep-sea counterparts with reduced filtering systems, evolving alternative prey capture methods like trapping and sticky tentacles.

In the deep ocean, animals often await food particles rather than actively searching, resulting in a stealthy feeding style with lures and elongated appendages. They have also developed ways of coping with much larger food particles. Fishes tend to have enlarged teeth and jaws, with flexible articulations to dislocate the jaw, allowing them to swallow prey whole.
