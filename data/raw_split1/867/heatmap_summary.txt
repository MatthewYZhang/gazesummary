Loie Fuller, an American dancer (1862–1928), sought to transcend the artistic limitations of late nineteenth-century theatrical dance by focusing on visual effects. Fuller devised a dance form centered on the interplay of lights and colors on her voluminous skirts, kept in constant motion through arm movements, sometimes aided by concealed wands. She rejected ballet's technical virtuosity, likely due to her minimal formal training, and instead emphasized the drama of her dancing through visual effects, rather than storytelling or emotions.

Fuller found great success in Paris, becoming "La Loie" at the Folies Bergère in 1892. Her dances, often representing elements or natural objects aligned with the Art Nouveau style.

Fuller experimented with electrical lighting, colored gels, and slide projections, inventing and patenting mirror arrangements and chemical dyes. This interest in color and light mirrored that of artists like Seurat. She invented underlighting, placing herself on illuminated frosted glass.

Her technological expertise evolved, leading her to incorporate music from composers like Stravinsky and Wagner and to explore ambitious themes such as The Sea and created Radium Dance, which simulated the phosphorescence of that element. She befriended Marie and Pierre Curie and appeared in films. She sponsored Duncan’s first appearance in Europe.

Fuller is remembered for her innovations in stage lighting and her influence on other dancers such as Isadora Duncan and Ruth St.Denis.
