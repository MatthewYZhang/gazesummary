The Industrial Revolution in Britain was significantly shaped by harnessing new sources of power. Before the reign of George â…¢, available power sources for work and travel remained unchanged since the Middle Ages, primarily relying on animal or human muscles, wind, and running water. Running water was suitable for continuous machine operation, but its geographical limitations and seasonal variability posed challenges. The new age of machinery required a more consistent and movable power source.

James Watt perfected a separate condenser for the steam engine, improving its efficiency by eliminating the need to cool the cylinder at every stroke. Watt also devised a method to convert the piston's motion into rotary motion, transforming the inefficient pump into a versatile steam engine. The final improvement involved using steam to drive the piston both backward and forward, increasing speed and reducing fuel consumption.

Watt's steam engine quickly demonstrated its capabilities by freeing industry from its reliance on running water. The engine facilitated deeper mining by efficiently pumping out water. The availability of coal inspired William Murdoch to develop coal gas for nighttime illumination, providing an alternative to smoky oil lamps and candles. The rise of steam power, combined with readily available coal and iron ore, fueled the Industrial Revolution. Heavily laden wagons with flanged wheels were being hauled by horses along metal rails, and inventors eventually combined these ingredients by putting the engine on wheels and the wheels on the rails.
