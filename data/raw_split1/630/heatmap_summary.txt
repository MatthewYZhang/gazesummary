Trade played a crucial role in the formation of early states. Bartering, a basic trade mechanism, involved the exchange of commodities between individuals or groups and redistribution through society managed by chiefs. This redistribution was fundamental in chiefdoms. The evolution from redistribution to formal trade was closely related to political and social complexity, and the state's development in the ancient world.

In the 1970s, archaeologists emphasized trade's role in the rise of ancient states. Colin Renfrew attributed the Minoan civilization's flowering on Crete to intensified trade and the impact of olive and vine cultivation. He further suggested that this intensification, combined with increased economic interdependence, ultimately led to more complex palace-based societies. However, Renfrew's model has been questioned.

William Rathje proposed that an explosion in long-distance exchange was a cause of Mayan civilization. He suggested that deficiencies in resources like obsidian and salt in the lowland Mayan environment necessitated trade networks. Rathje also argued that Maya's long-distance trade networks were organized through local ceremonial centers and their leaders. Ultimately, state organization and the export of knowledge and materials emerged. However, his hypothesis is also subject to objections. Trade, influenced by transportation, demand, and the social context, remains a significant aspect of understanding complex societies.
