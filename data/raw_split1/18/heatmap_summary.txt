Desertification, defined as the expansion of desert-like conditions into previously unaffected areas, threatens an additional one-fourth of the Earth's land surface. It is primarily driven by the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation, leading to accelerated soil erosion by wind and water. In areas retaining soil cover, reduced vegetation impairs the soil's water absorption capacity, causing increased runoff and accelerated erosion rates, leading to further vegetation loss.

Human activities are the main driver of desertification rather than natural processes. Semiarid lands are ecologically fragile and have limited capacity to withstand increased environmental pressures from growing populations, seeking food and fuel. Four activities identified as major contributors include overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The cultivation of crops in drier regions often results in crop failures, leaving land susceptible to erosion due to the removal of natural vegetation. Overirrigation also leads to soil salinization, creating a white crustal layer that hinders air and water penetration, impacting the soil's health. The seriousness of desertification stems from its vast scope and the difficulty in reversing the process, which requires extensive land protection and cover-crop planting to reverse deterioration.
