Agriculture in Africa may have developed independently, but it is believed that the spread of agriculture and iron linked Africa to the Near East and Mediterranean world. The Sahara desert's desiccation pushed many people south, and they settled in scattered hunting-and-gathering bands. Agriculture reached these people from the Near East, bringing crops like millets and sorghums. Africans developed their own crops and were receptive to new imports. Domesticated African crops extend from Ethiopia across southern Sudan to West Africa. Subsequently, crops such as bananas were introduced from Southeast Asia. Livestock, including cattle, sheep, and goats, also arrived from Asia. Horses were introduced by the Hyksos invaders and spread across the Sudan to West Africa. Camels were introduced around the first century A.D. and transformed the desert into a more accessible trade route. Iron came from West Asia. Unlike the Americas, Africans had iron from an early date. The diffusion of agriculture and iron was accompanied by a movement of people, likely from eastern Nigeria, speaking a proto-Bantu language.
