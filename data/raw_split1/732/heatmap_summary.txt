Coral reefs, restricted to the intertropical zone, require ocean water temperatures not less than 21 Â°C and a firm substratum. They thrive in waters where excessive river-borne sediment does not darken the seawater, and a platform within 30 to 40 meters of the surface is essential. The structure of reefs is dominated by the skeletons of corals, which are carnivorous animals. Reef size varies, with Kwajelein atoll in the Marshall Islands reaching 120 kilometers long. The Great Barrier Reef, a 2,000-kilometer complex off Australia's northeast coast, is the largest coral structure. Darwin's observations led him to recognize fringing reefs, barrier reefs, and atolls and their relationship. Fringing reefs are close to the shore, with an uneven surface sloping into the sea. Barrier reefs have a wide lagoon, and atolls are ring-shaped. Darwin's theory suggests that the upward growth of coral from a sinking platform explains the succession of reef types, confirmed by deep boreholes in Pacific atolls in the 1950s. Coral reefs are extremely important habitats with a diversity of coral genera.
