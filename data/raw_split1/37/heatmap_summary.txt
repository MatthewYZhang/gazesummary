Plant communities assemble themselves flexibly, and their particular structure depends on the specific history of the area. Ecologists use the term “succession” to refer to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community, while the long-lived community at the end of succession is called a climax community. Pioneer and successional plant communities change over periods from 1 to 500 years, and climax communities change over periods of time greater than about 500 years. We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem. Stability can be defined as simply lack of change. The patchiness of the environment, an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is uniform.
