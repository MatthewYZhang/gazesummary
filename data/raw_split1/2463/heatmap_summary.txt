The facial pits of snakes are specialized infrared receptors that allow them to strike warm-blooded prey. Snakes can strike correctly even when blindfolded, provided that the prey is warmer than the surroundings. The sensitivity of the facial pit has been examined, and it has been found that the nerve activity changes when objects of different temperatures are brought into the receptive field around the snake's head. The mechanism of infrared radiation sensing remains under investigation, with a discarded hypothesis involving the deformation of a membrane due to gas expansion. A more probable explanation points towards the organ's sensitivity to slight temperature rises caused by infrared radiation, and pure infrared radiation experiments provide strong evidence that the mode of reception in the facial pit organ is entirely thermal. The question of stereoscopic vision, electric activity can be recorded from the optic tectum, which is the part of the brain with which the optic nerve is connected. This is suggestive, considering that the same part of the brain is used to handle visual information, which is known to be stereoscopic, and infrared information. It appears that facial pits do provide stereoscopic perception and substantially aid in the precision of estimating the location of prey.
