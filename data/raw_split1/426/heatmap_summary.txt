The Industrial Revolution was partly driven by the problem of energy. Before the steam engine, people relied on energy derived from plants, animal, and human muscle. The increased efficiency in water and wind power helped with tasks like pumping and milling, but Great Britain faced an energy shortage, particularly with wood being a primary source of heat diminishing in supply.

James Watt designed an efficient steam engine in the late 1700s, which was used to drain coal mines and increased the production of coal. The steam engine led to mills using steam power to spin and weave cotton, and their location was no longer dependent on rivers. The import of raw cotton increased 230 times between 1760 and 1850, and British cotton goods production increased sixtyfold.

The availability of steam power transformed the iron industry with coal-derived coke replacing charcoal. Steam-powered rolling mills produced finished iron, expanding the annual iron output significantly. The demand for more machines and higher-quality iron drove these developments. Steam power and iron revolutionized transport, and the arrival of the steam engine transformed rail transportation, expanding the Industrial Revolution. The availability of jobs in railway construction attracted many rural laborers.
