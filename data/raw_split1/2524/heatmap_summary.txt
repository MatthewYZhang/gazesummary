In the 1920s, Aleksandr Oparin theorized that life originated in warm, watery environments on early Earth under a methane-rich atmosphere. Early seas, believed to be rich in organic molecules, reacted to form complex molecules, eventually leading to proteins and life. Stanley Miller later demonstrated that amino acids, essential for life's proteins, could form under conditions resembling early Earth. Miller's experiment involved passing electric discharges through a mixture of methane, hydrogen, ammonia, and steam, resulting in the creation of amino acids. The discharges were a proxy for lightning. This experiment has been considered a landmark in understanding the natural synthesis of amino acids, a crucial step in the evolution of life on Earth. However, the exact environmental conditions on early Earth are uncertain, and Miller's experiments may not directly reflect the early Archean eon. The early atmosphere was likely rich in carbon dioxide rather than methane, resembling the atmospheres of Mars and Venus. Carbon dioxide is converted to limestone in the carbon cycle, resulting in more carbon dioxide stored as limestone than in the atmosphere.
