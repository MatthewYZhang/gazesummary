Ancient Rome possessed a quality of cohesiveness unlike Greece or any other civilization, ancient or modern. The Roman world was unified into a massive, monolithic entity through physical, organizational, and psychological controls, similar to the Roman wall held together by design and cement. Physical bonds included military garrisons in every province and stone-built roads linking them to Rome. Organizational bonds were based on law, administration, and a universal army enforcing common standards. Psychological controls relied on fear and punishment, ensuring the destruction of anything threatening Rome's authority.

The Roman genius extended to law, military organization, administration, and engineering, leading to literary and artistic sensibilities. While modern opinions of Rome vary, some see Rome as an imitator of Greece, excelling in quantity rather than quality. Rome had a significant debt to Greece, adopting Greek religion, moral philosophy, and literature, with educated Romans expected to be fluent in Greek. However, Rome projected its unique genius into various spheres.
