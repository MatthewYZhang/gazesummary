North American native grasslands are mostly found in the Great Plains, located in the middle of the continent. This prairie biome ranks as one of the world's most extensive grasslands, stretching from the Rocky Mountains to the deciduous forest, and from northern Mexico to Canada. The rainfall varies from 40 cm in the west to 80 cm in the east. Temperatures range between 10 and 20 degrees Celsius. In these grasslands, rainfall is seasonal and temperatures fluctuate.

One hundred years ago, the Great Plains grasslands were a vast prairie. But now much of the prairie is farmland and native grasses have been replaced by alien species. These are home to millions of glacial depressions now known as prairie potholes which are important breeding areas for more than 300 bird species. They fill with water during the spring and dry out by late summer. They are where birds mate, producing half of North America's ducks. Finally, scientists have discovered that prairie potholes hold an average of 2.5 tons of carbon per acre per year when not being farmed.
