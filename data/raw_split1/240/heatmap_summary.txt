Mass extinctions are events where many species become extinct within a geologically short time. There was a significant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 70 million years ago, and an even larger one at the end of the Permian period, about 250 million years ago. The fossil record shows at least five mass extinctions in which many families of marine organisms died out, and the rates of extinction today are as great as during these mass extinctions, leading scientists to believe a sixth mass extinction is in progress.

Several hypotheses attempt to explain these high rates of extinction, including warming or cooling of Earth, changes in seasonal fluctuations or ocean currents, and changing positions of the continents. Other hypotheses include ecological changes. American paleontologists David Raup and John Sepkoski suggest extinction episodes recurred periodically, about every 26 million years.

The asteroid-impact hypothesis, suggested by Luis and Walter Alvarez, has gained attention and posits that Earth collided with an asteroid, spewing debris into the atmosphere and causing reduced photosynthesis and starvation. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of the rare-earth element iridium in sedimentary deposits, as debris from the collision would contain large amounts of iridium. Additionally, the intense heat of the impact would produce heat-shocked quartz, and secondary craters have been found along Mexicoâ€™s Yucatan Peninsula. A location called Chicxulub has been suggested as the primary impact site.
