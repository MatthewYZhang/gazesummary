Infantile amnesia refers to the inability of adults to recall events from their early years, typically before the age of three. While adults have excellent recognition of pictures of people who attended high school with them 35 years earlier, one explanation, that infants do not form enduring memories, has been proven incorrect. Children two and a half to three years old can remember experiences that occurred in their first year, and eleven month olds can remember some events a year later. The hypothesis that infantile amnesia reflects repression of sexually charged episodes is also insufficient to explain the phenomenon, as people cannot remember ordinary events from the infant and toddler periods either. Other explanations include physiological changes, the influence of language, and the fit between how infants encode and older individuals retrieve information. The maturation of the frontal lobes of the brain is critical for remembering particular episodes. These explanations are not mutually exclusive and support each other.
