Japan's climate is determined by prevailing westerly winds from Eurasia, cyclonic airflows from the western equatorial Pacific, and winter cold air masses from Siberia. These cold winds gather moisture over the Sea of Japan, depositing snow on Honshu's western mountains and bringing cold, dry weather to valleys and plains. The Siberian air mass warms in spring, ushering in moisture-laden air to southern Japan in June and July, followed by a drier summer suited for rice cultivation. Summer heat gives way to unpredictable autumn rains from typhoons. These storms travel clockwise, shifting from westward to northward and eastward, revitalizing the Siberian air mass and beginning a new annual cycle. The yearly cycle has played a key role in shaping Japanese civilization. The islands have ample precipitation that support uncommonly lush forest cover, but the combination of precipitous slopes and heavy rainfall also gives the islands one of the worldâ€™s highest rates of natural erosion. Summer weather patterns in northern Honshu, and especially along the Sea of Japan, have also discouraged agriculture. The area is subject to the yamase effect. The impact of this effect has been especially great on rice cultivation. Most precipitation comes in the form of rain and the bulk of it in spring, summer, and fall, when most useful for cultivation.
