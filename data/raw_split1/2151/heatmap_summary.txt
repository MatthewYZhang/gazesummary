In the open sea, food is often reliably available, allowing animals to prioritize energy conservation, especially in the deeper ocean where food levels are greatly reduced. In the near-surface layers, a diverse array of planktonic animals thrive, filtering plankton from water currents using specialized anatomical structures. These filter-feeders flourish in well-illuminated surface waters, supported by the abundance of organisms from bacteria to larval crustaceans. Even fish can become filter-feeders in these conditions. Marine fish are mostly carnivores, but when phytoplankton is abundant, they support huge populations of filter-feeding sardines and anchovies, which use their gill filaments to strain out algae. These fish are a valuable food resource for local carnivores like seabirds. Baleen whales and whale sharks, larger filter-feeders, consume small animals in productive coastal and polar waters. In deeper waters, where filter-feeders are less successful due to the scarcity of particles, some species have developed larger filtering systems or forage in concentrated particle layers. Predatory behavior emerges, while filtering systems become less developed.  In deeper ocean waters, animals adopt a strategy of waiting for food particles or prey to arrive. This leads to a stealthier feeding style, with emphasis on lures and evolved appendages. As prey is less available, animals evolve to handle larger food particles, with fishes developing larger teeth and jaws, allowing the mouth opening to dislocate, and requiring the swallowing of prey whole.
