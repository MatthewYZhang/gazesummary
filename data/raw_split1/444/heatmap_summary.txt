Earthâ€™s surface is composed of tectonic plates that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, some carrying islands or continents, others forming the seafloor. These plates float on the mantle and move slowly. The plate boundaries consist of spreading ridges, subduction zones, or transform faults, where most volcanic and earthquake activity occurs.
Notably, some islands, like the Hawaiian islands, are volcanoes formed far from plate boundaries, originating from activity within the Pacific Plate. The Hawaiian Islands form a chain, extending northwest from the island of Hawaii, showing a pattern of increasing erosion and age towards the northwest. Tuzo Wilson suggested that this age progression results from the surface plate moving over a stationary volcanic source in the interior. The dating of lavas confirmed this, indicating the volcanoes are produced by mantle plumes, which are columns of molten rock rising from deep within the mantle, creating hot spots. 
These oceanic volcanic islands and hot-spot trails are helpful for geologists because they record the past locations of plates. The current position of the Pacific Plate, with Hawaii above the Pacific Ocean hot spot, allows for determining past positions by moving the plate so that an older volcano sits at the current location of Hawaii.
