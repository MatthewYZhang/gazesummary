The rise of early civilizations was stimulated by the development of settled agriculture, which led to changes in the organization of human communities and the rise of large ancient empires. Farming may have emerged independently in different areas due to increasing population and declining food resources. Farmers began to plant seeds in the ground, relying on simple techniques and other food production methods. The real breakthrough came when farmers cultivated crops along river system floodplains because crops were not dependent on rainfall. An additional benefit was that the sediment carried by the river deposited nutrients in the soil, enabling the farmer to cultivate a single plot for many years without moving. River valley agriculture became a decisive factor in the rise of the first civilizations in Asia and Africa. Increased food production led to population growth, and efforts to control water flow for irrigation and protect inhabitants led to cooperative activities. The need to oversee this process led to the emergence of an elite that was eventually transformed into a government.
