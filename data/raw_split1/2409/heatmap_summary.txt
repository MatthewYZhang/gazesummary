Around 2,500 years ago, Amerindian peoples in the southwestern United States began to live in settled communities, growing maize with squash and later beans. These cultures developed advanced technologies to manipulate their environment in arid conditions. One such culture, the Hohokam, practiced irrigation-based agriculture, using archaeological remains and current technologies to understand their systems. The Hohokam manipulated the arid environment by building large canals to fertilize thousands of acres with water from the Salt and Gila river systems. They were able to grow crops and store them throughout the year, ensuring a continual supply of food. However, irrigation led to salinization of the land, potentially forcing them to abandon their villages. The Anasazi also developed advanced technologies and constructed multistoried communal houses along the edges of a river in Chaco Canyon. The Anasazi also developed vast agricultural network and pueblos. The Anasazi used their understanding of astronomy to predict growing and harvesting seasons. The Anasazi disappeared around the end of the thirteenth century. Factors such as deforestation, social disruption, and drought may have contributed to the abandonment of their pueblos.
