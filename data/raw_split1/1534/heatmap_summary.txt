The presence of water on other planets, particularly Mars, is a crucial factor in determining the possibility of life. In the 19th century, it was widely believed that life was common in the solar system, with Mars being a prime target in the search for life. New photographic technology aided astronomers in their exploration of Mars. In 1888, Giovanni Schiaparelli's images revealed a network of long, thin, dark lines across Mars' surface, which he termed "canali". These features were interpreted as canals, suggesting to some scientists that they were artificially created.

Evidence suggests that liquid water once existed on Mars and that its presence is generally accepted. Though the surface of Mars is dry today, it contains ice and signs of past liquid water. Data has revealed that water was once abundant across a large region of Mars, potentially in shallow lakes or seas. These bodies of water may have existed for billions of years, creating habitable conditions.
