Infants have good auditory perception at birth, even surpassing adults in sensitivity to very high and low frequencies. Initially, they are less sensitive to middle-range frequencies, but this improves over time. Their ability to hear high and low frequencies declines after infancy, potentially due to noise exposure. Infants are able to localize sound, though their smaller heads pose a slight handicap.

Infants can make fine discriminations necessary for language understanding, demonstrated by their response to different sounds like "ba" and "pa." They can differentiate languages, showing preferences for familiar languages as young as two days old, and distinguish between languages by five months. Infants show preferences for voices, particularly their mother's voice, which may be influenced by prenatal exposure. Newborns preferred the mother's voice, but didn't prefer the father's voice over other male voices. They prefer to listen to melodies they heard prenatally.
