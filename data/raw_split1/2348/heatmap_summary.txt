Before 1750, colonists in North America did not consider themselves a distinct people. There was no American government or unified political organization. America was seen as a geographic region rather than a unified nation. The American colonists of 1750 would have identified as English or British. Despite a diverse population, English people and institutions dominated, and colonists thought of England as home. However, American institutions differed from those in England, allowing colonists to select and develop ideas that suited their circumstances. Some ideas, institutions, and attitudes became common in all colonies and were not common in England.

American colonists developed representative governments where citizens chose officials, which differed from England's system. Representative government in England originated in the Middle Ages with the king calling on men for advice. These men were chosen by their neighbors and informed the king of his subjects' wishes. Eventually, their advice became compelling and resulted in the House of Commons. The assemblies of American colonial representatives were more democratic compared to English model and knew nothing of virtual representation. A colonial representative was supposed to be an agent of the people who chose him, and supposed to look after their interests first and those of the colony second.
