The expansion of the western frontier, in accordance with the National Policy, led to the opening of a new northern frontier that enhanced Canadian industrial development. The Canadian Shield and the western Cordilleras became mineral, timber, and hydroelectric power treasuries. In 1883, CPR construction crews in northern Ontario discovered copper and nickel deposits near Sudbury, which became the world's largest nickel producer. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway led to the discovery of rich silver deposits around Cobalt in 1903, triggering a mining boom.

The Klondike gold rush in 1896 attracted fortune-seekers. The Klondike strike was somewhat exaggerated and short-lived. The tales of sudden riches, heroic and tragic exploits, and the rowdiness and lawlessness of the mining frontier were immortalized.

British Columbia's forests satisfied construction demands, and the softwood forest wealth of the Cordilleras and the Shield became a pulpwood source for the development of the pulp and paper industry. Fast flowing rivers were harnessed for hydroelectric power. The age of electricity under public ownership and control began with the Ontario Hydro-Electric Power Commission.

Western settlement stimulated industrial expansion. The National Policy increased the demand for eastern manufactured goods, including agricultural implements, iron and steel foundries, machine shops, railway yards, textile mills, boot and shoe factories, and smaller manufacturing enterprises. American firms opened branches in Canada, with governments offering incentives. Over $600 million of American capital flowed into mining and the pulp and paper industry, while British investors contributed to railway building, business development, and urban infrastructure. The gross value of Canadian manufactured products quadrupled from 1891 to 1916.
