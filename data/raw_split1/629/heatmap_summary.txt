Earth has abundant water and little carbon dioxide in its thin atmosphere, contrasting with Venus, which is dry with a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Volcanoes on both planets originally released gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Water probably once dominated the Venusian atmosphere, outgassed by Venusian volcanoes, akin to Earth's, and the similar impact rates of comets. With a weaker early Sun, water vapor could have formed oceans on Venus. Carbon dioxide on Earth is dissolved in oceans or bound in carbonate rocks, whereas Earth could develop a Venus-like atmosphere if its carbon dioxide were released.

Venus' oceans limited carbon dioxide through dissolution and carbonate rock formation. Closer to the Sun, water would have vaporized and formed thick water vapor clouds, trapping heat through the greenhouse effect. This resulted in temperatures rising until oceans evaporated above 374Â°C and intensified the greenhouse effect. Without oceans, carbon dioxide accumulated, and high temperatures "baked out" trapped carbon dioxide, forming Venus's current atmosphere. The process eventually leveled off after water vapor was broken down.
