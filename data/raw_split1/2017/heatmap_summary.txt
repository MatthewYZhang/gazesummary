Comets, interesting and unpredictable bodies, are composed of frozen gases like water vapor, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide that bind rocky and metallic materials. Many comets travel in elongated orbits far beyond Pluto, with long-period comets taking hundreds of thousands of years to orbit the Sun. Short-period comets, like Halley's Comet, have orbital periods under 200 years and regularly encounter the inner solar system.

As a comet nears the Sun, solar energy vaporizes its frozen gases, creating a glowing head called the coma, varying in size and sometimes containing a small glowing nucleus. Some comets develop tails extending millions of kilometers, though comets are relatively small compared to other solar system members. The tail points away from the Sun due to radiation pressure pushing dust particles and solar wind moving ionized gases like carbon monoxide.

Comets originate in two regions of the outer solar system. Short-period comets are thought to reside beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt, while long-period comets have elliptical orbits from the Oort cloud, a spherical shell around the solar system. Finally, Halley's Comet, a famous short-period comet with a 76-year orbital period, was visible in daylight in 1910 and last approached in 1986.
