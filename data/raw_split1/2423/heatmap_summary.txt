Research suggests that aging is influenced by age genes, though the evidence is still not conclusive. Christopher Wills believes that science may isolate the mammalian age genes in mice by 2025 and that these genes, when located in humans, could extend the human lifespan, perhaps to 150 years, given that humans and mice share many genes and similar body chemistry. If located, the next step would be to see if they have counterparts in humans. Another tactic may be to compare genetic backgrounds to determine similar aging genes.

Caloric restriction is the only laboratory-tested theory of age extension and has been scrutinized for decades. Animals that consume calories just above starvation levels live significantly longer than average. Although it seems to fly in the face of common sense that well fed animals should have greater resistance, scientists have consistently increased the lifespan of rats and mice in the laboratory through calorie restriction. Across the animal kingdom, lifespan is inversely correlated to metabolism rate. It was also shown that lower calorie intake led to reduced rates of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes in monkeys.

Ron Hart believes that the answer to aging ties in the high body temperature of mammals and DNA damage. Hart says that reducing caloric intake reduces spontaneous DNA damage by 24%. Lower calorie intake leads to increased antioxidants. Hart found a fourfold increase in the enzyme catalase and a threefold increase in superoxide dismutase in animals on a restricted diet. In 1993 he began the first systematic studies of caloric restrictions in humans.
