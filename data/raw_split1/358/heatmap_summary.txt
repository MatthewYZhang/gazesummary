Spartina alterniflora, or cordgrass, is a perennial plant native to the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the U.S., dominating lower salt marshes in the intertidal zone. These marshes are very productive, with nutrient-rich water brought in by tides enabling high food production. Decaying marsh grass feeds bacteria, insects, crustaceans, and snails, which excrete nutrient-rich wastes. Insects live in the marsh, while birds and mammals eat the cordgrass directly. Tidal cycles move plant material offshore for subtidal organisms.

Spartina spreads via underground stems or when root pieces or whole plants float to a new area. It grows on various substrates and tolerates different salinities. It's also tolerant of toxic sulfides in marsh sediments, and uses carbon dioxide efficiently. Spartina stabilizes estuaries, trapping sediment and evolving into high marsh systems, but can be gradually replaced by other species. In Washington State, Spartina, without its predators, crowds out native plants, alters the landscape, and affects oyster and crab fisheries. It has been transplanted for land reclamation but has spread rapidly in New Zealand, reducing bird and animal populations. Efforts to control Spartina are ongoing, including using herbicides and other methods, with biological controls considered a distant possibility.
