Callisto, one of Jupiter's satellites, orbits the planet in seventeen days at a distance of two million kilometers. Like our own Moon, Callisto rotates in the same period as it revolves, so it always keeps the same face toward Jupiter. Its noontime surface temperature is only about -140Â°C, so water ice is stable on its surface year-round.  Callisto has a diameter of 4.820 kilometers, almost the same as that of Mercury.  Its mass is only one-third as great, which means its density must be only one-third as great as well. This tells us that Callisto has far less of the rocky metallic materials and is mostly icy.

Callisto has not fully differentiated into layers of different density materials and it lacks a dense core. Only a little heating will soften the ice and get the process started, allowing the rock and metal to sink to the center and the slushy ice to float to the surface. The surface of Callisto is covered with impact craters.  In thinking of ice so far from the Sun, it is important not to judge its behavior from that of the much warmer ice we know on Earth.  Callisto is unique in its absence of interior forces to drive geological evolution.
