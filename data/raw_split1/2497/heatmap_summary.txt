Comets, when distant from the Sun, are small objects consisting mainly of ices like water, methane, and ammonia, with embedded dust, akin to a dirty ice ball. Approaching the Sun, the icy matter vaporizes, releasing dust and forming a vast halo known as the coma around the nucleus. Sunlight reflected off the dust particles makes the coma visible from Earth.

The comet's tail forms as it nears the Sun. Two tail types exist: the dust tail and the ion tail. The dust tail arises from sunlight reflecting off coma dust particles, with photons imparting momentum to the dust. This creates a curving trail of dust, millions of kilometers long, characterized by its yellowish color. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can break down the vapor molecules in the coma into their constituents. Excited atoms and ions emit light as they return to lower-energy states, illuminating the coma. Both the dust and ion tails extend out from the coma in the direction away from the Sun.

These tails extend significantly, potentially spanning tens or hundreds of millions of kilometers. Comets leave a trail of matter, leading to debris scattered along Earth's orbit. These particles enter Earth's atmosphere at high velocity, producing meteors. Since comets lose matter on each pass by the Sun, eventually it will be depleted to the point where it is no longer visible. It is proposed that a giant cloud surrounds the Sun, containing large chunks of matter like the nuclei of comets.
