Termites, often called white ants, are social insects living in colonies, sometimes with millions of individuals. Unlike ants, termites undergo gradual metamorphosis with three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Worker and soldier castes consist of both males and females. These insects must live in moist places with high humidity, ideally above 96 percent in their nests.

Tropical termites, like the African species Macroternes natalensis, are ingenious engineers, constructing huge above-ground nests with built-in "air conditioning" that keeps the nest moist, at a constant temperature. These mounds, described by Martin Luscher, are up to 16 feet tall and have thick walls of soil and termite saliva to insulate the interior.

The nest's interior contains a large central core for fungus cultivation, a "cellar" of empty space below, and an "attic" above, with tunnels connecting them. Warm air rises to the attic, flows through the ridges, and returns to the cellar. The ridges are thin, gases diffuse, and air flows with oxygen to the inhabitants.
