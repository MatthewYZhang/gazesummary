One of the most significant evolutionary events was the transition of water-dwelling fish to terrestrial tetrapods. By the Devonian Period, fish had radiated into almost all available aquatic habitats, including freshwater settings. Lobe-finned fish are common fossils in freshwater deposits. The freshwater Devonian lobe-finned fish rhipidistian crossopterygian is of particular interest to biologists studying tetrapod evolution. The delta rocks in which these fossils are found are commonly red, indicating that the deltas formed in a climate that had alternate wet and dry periods. Adaptations allowing the fish to survive the dry conditions would have been advantageous. These fish had lungs as well as gills for breathing, with lungs serving as an auxiliary breathing device.

The fins were thick, fleshy, and quite sturdy, with a median axis of bone down the center. They could have been used as feeble locomotor devices on land. The bones of the fins of a Devonian rhipidistian exactly match in number and position the limb bones of the earliest known tetrapods, the amphibians. What ecological pressures might have caused fishes to gradually abandon their watery habitat and become increasingly land-dwelling creatures? The ancestors of these animals already had a circulation system, and they were mobile, so that they could move to water to drink. Furthermore, they already had lungs, which rhipidistians presumably used for auxiliary breathing.
