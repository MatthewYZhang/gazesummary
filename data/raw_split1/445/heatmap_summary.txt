Predator-prey dynamics can be complex. Initially, it was thought that wolves would control the moose population on Isle Royale, but studies showed that wolves primarily consume old or diseased animals. The moose population is mainly regulated by food availability and disease. Under controlled laboratory conditions, predators can exterminate prey and then become extinct themselves, if there are no safe areas for the prey. However, if prey has safe areas, then the prey population drops to low levels, which leads to predator population decline. Then the prey population can rebound and create a cyclical pattern. Ecologists have observed the North American snowshoe hare, which follows a ten-year cycle, influenced by food plants and predators. As hare density increases, the quantity of willow and birch twigs decreases, forcing the hares to feed on low-quality food, which leads to a decline in hare abundance. Field experiments have demonstrated that both food availability and predators affect the cycle of snowshoe hares. Predators also play a role in maintaining diverse ecological communities, preventing competitor exclusion by controlling dominant species.
