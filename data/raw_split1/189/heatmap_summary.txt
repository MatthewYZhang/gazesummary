The shift from silent to sound film at the end of the 1920s marks the most important transformation in motion picture history. The basic division in cinema history lies between films that are mute and films that speak. Yet this fundamental standard conceals a host of paradoxes. Movie theaters had a piano or organ to provide musical accompaniment to silent pictures, and audiences experienced elaborate aural presentations. Examples of this include Japanese benshi and original musical compositions performed by symphony-size orchestras. Beyond that, the triumph of recorded sound has overshadowed the rich diversity of technological and aesthetic experiments with the visual image that were going forward simultaneously in the 1920s. Though some critics predicted sound film would be a technical novelty, they neglected to account for the new forces in the motion picture field that would not take no for an answer. In the United States, the conversion to sound was virtually complete by 1930.
