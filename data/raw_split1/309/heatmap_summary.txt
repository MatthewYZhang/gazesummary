In the nineteenth century, Louis Agassiz, a glacier scientist, immigrated from Switzerland to the United States and became a professor at Harvard University. He studied geology and saw signs of glacial erosion and sedimentation in many regions. Agassiz saw moraines that reminded him of terminal moraines in the Alps, and the heterogeneous material of the drift convinced him of its glacial origin.

The areas covered by this material were so vast that the ice must have been a continental glacier. Agassiz convinced geologists and the public that a continental glaciation had extended the polar ice caps far into regions that now enjoy temperate climates, leading to the concept of ice ages. Geologists found fossil evidence of warming and cooling of the oceans and shells differ in their proportion of ordinary oxygen and the heavy oxygen isotope. Isotopic analysis of shells allowed geologists to measure another glacial effect. More of the heavy isotope is left behind in the ocean and absorbed by marine organisms.
