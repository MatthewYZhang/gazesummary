Brazilian independence, unlike the turbulent transitions in Spanish America, unfolded rather peacefully between 1808 and 1822. The concept of independence originated in the late 18th century, spurred by the Portuguese policy of tightening political and economic control. A significant conspiracy formed in Minas Gerais from 1788-1799, triggered by governmental control over gold and diamonds and heavy taxes. However, this conspiracy was easily suppressed, along with other conspiracies and a brief revolt in 1817, reflecting republican ideals. The French invasion of Portugal in 1807 resulted in the Portuguese court relocating to Rio de Janeiro, bringing advantages to Brazil. Prince Joao VI opened Brazilian ports to friendly nations, established local industries, and founded the Bank of Brazil. In 1815, Brazil became a kingdom coequal with Portugal.

The revolution of 1820 in Portugal was the catalyst for Brazil's final break. Portuguese revolutionaries sought the return of King Joao and the end of the dual monarchy. Joao, pressured by his courtiers, approved a new constitution and departed for Portugal, leaving his son Pedro behind. He privately instructed Pedro to lead the movement if Brazilians demanded independence. The Portuguese parliament intended to revert the liberties and concessions won by Brazil since 1808, prompting Pedro, urged by Brazilian advisors, to famously declare "I remain" on January 9. On September 7, now known as Independence Day, Pedro issued the "Independence or death!" proclamation and was declared constitutional Emperor of Brazil in December 1822.
