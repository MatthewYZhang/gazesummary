Oceania consists of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Micronesia lies north of Melanesia, while Polynesia is the central Pacific area, with Hawaii, Easter Island, and New Zealand defining the great triangle. Pre-European populations in Polynesia and Micronesia were estimated at 700,000. The Pacific islanders were thought to come from North America, South America, Egypt, Israel, India, as well as Southeast Asia. Some theorists suggested Egyptians navigated and colonized the Pacific. Thor Heyerdahl attempted to prove that Pacific islanders descended from Native Americans and later proposed three migrations: Native Americans to Hawaii, Peruvians to Easter Island, and Melanesians. Countering these theories, evidence points to the Pacific islanders originating from Southeast Asia, where Austronesian-speaking peoples began to emerge around 5000 B.C.E., possessing cultivated plants and advanced maritime skills. The colonization of the Pacific was likely driven by deliberate expeditions, equipped with food and domesticated animals, rather than accidental drift, which is supported by computer simulations of winds and currents. The pre-Columbian presence of the sweet potato in Oceania is explained by Polynesian navigators bringing it from South America.
