In the open sea, animals often find food reliably available, allowing them to prioritize energy conservation. However, in the deeper layers of the ocean, food levels are greatly reduced, and animals must maximize their energy input. 
In near-surface layers, planktonic animals feed on plankton by filtering it from the water. These filter-feeders thrive in well-lit surface waters due to the abundance of small organisms. Although most marine fishes are carnivores, filter-feeding sardines and anchovies can thrive in productive regions with high phytoplankton concentrations, using their gill filaments to strain out algae. At a much larger scale, baleen whales and whale sharks are efficient filter-feeders in productive waters. However, filtering seawater can be energetically demanding, particularly for planktonic animals. The deep sea has lower levels of organic matter, making it difficult for filter-feeders to survive. Consequently, there are fewer successful filter-feeders in deep water.
In the deeper waters, animals tend to await the arrival of food particles, minimizing energy expenditure, leading to a stealthy style of feeding. They have evolved lures and elongated appendages to increase the volume of water monitored. Many animals have developed ways of coping with larger food particles. Fishes in the deep sea tend to have enlarged teeth and jaws, with flexible articulations allowing them to dislocate their jaws and swallow prey whole.
