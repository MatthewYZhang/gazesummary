Fluids, such as liquids and gases, flow and adapt to the shape of containers, driving planetary resurfacing. These processes are powered by the Sun and planetary gravity, and they alter surfaces by moving particles and inducing chemical reactions. Venus and Earth, once similar in size, composition, and initial endowments of carbon dioxide and water, evolved differently due to their distance from the Sun. Venus, with its internal heat, continues to display volcanic activity and lacks surface water bodies.

Venus may have once had as much water as Earth, but its proximity to the Sun caused evaporation and the breakdown of water molecules, with hydrogen escaping into space. Consequently, Venus retained a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere, leading to a strong greenhouse effect and high surface temperatures. Earth's temperature allows water to exist in liquid, solid, and gas forms. Water cycles between oceans, the atmosphere, and river systems. Unlike Venus, liquid water on Earth removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming carbonate sedimentary rocks, aiding in the planet's unique atmospheric composition and temperature regulation. The presence of liquid water also fostered life on Earth, contributing to its oxygen- and nitrogen-rich atmosphere.
