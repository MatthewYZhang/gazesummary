The Ogallala Aquifer is a vast sandstone formation beneath 583,000 square kilometers of land from Texas to South Dakota, containing water accumulated over 30,000 years. This aquifer underlies much of the High Plains, which was settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880s. The region has a semiarid climate, supporting a low-intensity agricultural economy for 50 years after settlement. The aquifer was named after the Ogallala Sioux Indians.

Water from the Ogallala has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn. However, the unprecedented development of this finite resource has caused water tables to fall drastically. Farmers have reacted to the depletion of the Ogallala in various ways, including attempting to conserve water by irrigating less or switching to less water-intensive crops. Some believe in using the water while it remains economically viable, focusing on high-value crops. The incentive to conserve water is diminished by the knowledge that neighbors profit by using large amounts of water, depleting regional water supplies.
