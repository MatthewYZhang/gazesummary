Biodiversity has generally risen since the Cambrian period, which began about 600 million years ago and saw a great proliferation of macroscopic species. However, there have been notable exceptions, as biodiversity has collapsed dramatically during at least five periods due to mass extinctions. The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction is the best known of these events, marking the end of the age of dinosaurs and the rise of mammals. During this time, about 38 percent of marine animal families were lost, and the abundance of certain plant groups changed.

Scientists initially attributed these changes to climate cooling, but it is now believed that a meteorite impact 65 million years ago caused the K-T extinction. This theory was revolutionized in 1980 by Luis Alvarez, who proposed that a large meteorite generated a cloud of dust, reducing solar radiation and photosynthesis. The initial evidence for this theory was the discovery of a high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rocks at the K-T boundary, which later was supported by evidence of a circular impact formation in the Yucatan Peninsula.
