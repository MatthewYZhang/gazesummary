Cosmologists attempt to understand the origin and structure of the universe as a whole with the assumption that the universe is uniform. This assumption is called the "cosmological principle." One thing that is certain is that the universe is expanding, with distant galaxies moving away from each other.

There were two general classes of cosmological theories that fit with the expanding universe: the evolutionary (Big Bang) theory and the steady-state theory. The discovery in the 1960s of quasars, which are distant and bright, tipped the scales in favor of the Big Bang theory. The light now reaching us from quasars left them billions of years ago, which means we are seeing that state of the universe billions of years ago. The fact that almost all quasars are very far away implies that earlier in the history of the universe, quasars were developing more frequently than they are now. The steady-state theory is based on the "perfect cosmological principle," which maintains that the universe is uniform not only in space but in time. To make the steady-state theory compatible with the expanding universe, its proponents introduced the notion of continuous creation. However, quasars violate the perfect cosmological principle and are inconsistent with the steady-state view.
