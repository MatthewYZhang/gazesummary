Prior to the Late Preclassic period, Maya ceremonial centers had appeared, serving as community hubs but not substantial cities with large populations. Scholars labeled these centers "vacant towns" inhabited mainly by rulers, priests, attendants, and a few artisans, while the peasant population lived outside the center. Peasants would flock to these centers for religious festivals, and to help build temples and palaces. In return for labor and food, peasants received spiritual security, and trade goods. Agriculture was uncertain, so religion helped peasants cope with precarious lives by the proper propitiation of the gods for good crops.

William Haviland argues that the centralizing effects of Maya religion led to the rise of Classic Maya civilization, as religious centers acted as magnets and the agricultural systems became intensified. Haviland believes that these centers such as Tikal had begun transformation toward urban centers as early as 200 B.C. Other scholars attribute the growth of the ceremonial centers to trade. Rathje maintains that lowland sites were made bigger to attract highland merchants and their trade. This required attracting more artisans and laborers. Competition among centers may also have played a role.
