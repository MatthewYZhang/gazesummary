Seismic waves, generated by earthquakes, allow scientists to ascertain the location, thickness, and properties of Earth's internal zones. These waves are produced when rock masses break or rupture, with vibrations spreading in all directions. The principal categories include primary, secondary, and surface waves, which are all recorded by seismographs.

Primary waves (P-waves) are the fastest and arrive first at a seismograph after an earthquake and travel through the upper crust at 4 to 5 kilometers per second, speeding up to 6 to 7 kilometers per second near the crust's base. In P-waves, energy pulses are transmitted through compressions and expansions parallel to the wave's propagation. An earthquake drives a segment of rock into its neighbor, causing it to bounce back and strike the next particle, continuing the motion. This push-pull movement transmits energy through solids, liquids, and gases, with P-wave transmission speed depending on density and elastic properties. Surface waves are usually the primary cause of destruction that can result from earthquakes.
