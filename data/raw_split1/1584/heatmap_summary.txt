Memory, the brain's mechanism for storing and retrieving information from past experiences, occurs in two stages: short-term and long-term. Short-term memory, reflecting immediate sensory perception, enables actions like dialing a phone number after looking it up. Repeatedly using the number leads to its storage in long-term memory, where it can be recalled later. Short-term and long-term memory vary in their capacity and duration.

Information processing relies on our ability to attend and process environmental stimuli received through our senses. Experiences are briefly recorded in the sensory register, where a decision is made whether to further process them. Attending to information deemed meaningful or relevant transfers it to short-term memory, which can hold about seven unrelated bits of information. Short-term memory, often called working memory, holds information briefly, around 20 seconds. Without further processing, it's quickly forgotten. For instance, an interrupted phone call with an unfamiliar number may result in forgetting the number after a brief distraction.

Rehearsal, or repeated practice, and associating new data with existing long-term memory are control processes that facilitate the transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory.

Long-term memory is considered to have unlimited storage and contains permanent records. It influences the entire information processing system, affecting perceptions and how they are interpreted.  Long-term memory holds personal experiences, factual knowledge, and skills, distinguishing between learned facts and acquired skills. Retrieving factual knowledge is a conscious effort, whereas performing skills is often automatic.
