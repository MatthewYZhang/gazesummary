Agriculture in Africa has roots prior to 3000 B.C., possibly developing independently, but scholars often link its spread and that of iron to the Near East and Mediterranean. The Sahara's desertification pushed people south into sub-Saharan Africa, where they initially settled in hunting-gathering groups. Agriculture likely arrived from the Near East, as millets and sorghums originated in West Asia. Africans adapted and developed their own crops, like rice, and embraced new imports such as bananas from Southeast Asia.

Livestock, including cattle and horses, was introduced from Asia and used for transportation, including horses and chariots crossing the Sahara. Camels later proved crucial, enabling trade and communication through the desert. 

Iron came from West Asia, leading African societies directly into the Iron Age without a copper or bronze phase. The knowledge of iron-making was reaching Europe around the same time that it spread throughout West Africa. This technological shift led to iron representing power, and blacksmiths held important roles in society. The use of iron weapons allowed these populations to conquer those still using stone implements, contributing to the spread of people.
