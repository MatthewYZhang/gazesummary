The illusion of film is based on the fact that the moving pictures on the screen are not actually moving. A film is a series of still pictures or frames that appear to be moving because the retina of the human eye retains the impression of an object for a split second after it disappears. This principle is known as the persistence of vision. Special effects are another illusion of film, which filmmakers use when makeup, costume, and stunts are not enough to make a scene convincing. Special-effects artists apply science to filmmaking to show things that plain cameras could not photograph. One category of special effects is optical or visual effects, like stop-motion photography, pioneered by French filmmaker Georges Méliès, used to create the illusion of an actor disappearing on screen. Another category of special effects is mechanical effects, such as feathers or plastic chips to simulate snow. For example, in a 1916 silent film called The Flying Torpedo, mechanical effects created the appearance of an enemy invasion of the California seacoast with a model of toy ships and explosives. Often, optical and mechanical effects are used together, such as in the original 1933 version of King Kong, where stop-motion photography was used to create the illusion that Kong was moving up the Empire State Building.
