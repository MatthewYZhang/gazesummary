In the last half of the sixteenth century, England emerged as a commercial and manufacturing power in Europe. This growth was fueled by demographic, agricultural, and industrial changes. The population of England and Wales grew rapidly, reaching about 4.5 million in 1610. This increase resulted from reduced mortality rates and increased fertility, with expanding work opportunities in manufacturing and farming playing a role.

England's agricultural production expanded well before the European agricultural revolution, becoming more efficient and market-oriented. The yield of grain per acre increased significantly. Landowners brought more marshes and woodlands into cultivation. Some landowners and Yeomen organized their holdings for efficiency, selecting crops for sale in the London market. Landlords raised rents, altered conditions of land tenure, and evicted tenants who could not afford the terms.

England's economic development also drew the country's natural resources, including iron, timber, and coal. Textile manufacturing, particularly woolens, transformed the English economy. English merchants sold textiles in the Americas. The English textile trade was tied to Antwerp, and Sir Thomas Gresham enhanced the reputation of English business, allowing merchants to operate on credit.
