Civilization emerged in Egypt and Mesopotamia, where the earliest examples of writing have been found, primarily as inscribed clay tablets dating to shortly before 3000 B.C.E. These tablets were discovered among the Sumerians in southern Mesopotamia. While Egyptians also developed writing, its history is harder to track because they used perishable papyrus. The banks of the Nile were lined with papyrus plants, from which they made a form of paper that was excellent but fragile.

Mesopotamia's clay became a standard material for writing due to its durability and cheapness, surviving fires that would destroy papyrus. The Sumerians created a writing style suited to clay, using simple wedge shapes and lines incised with a reed or wooden stylus, known as cuneiform. Despite using basic shapes, there were hundreds of combinations. Early clay tablets contained notations of commodities like animals, jars, and baskets, indicating writing began as bookkeeping, then broadened to record daily life, from inventories to governmental rules.
