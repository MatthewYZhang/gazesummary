In the fourteenth century, Europe experienced an economic decline after three centuries of growth. A shift in climate played a role, as the fair weather of the preceding centuries turned worse. The average annual temperature dropped by approximately two degrees Celsius, which may sound small, but had a significant impact. This resulted in a shortened growing season, reduced resilience of vegetable species, and increased wind and rain, leading to decreased crop yields and a contracting agricultural economy. Consequently, food supplies dwindled, costs rose, and available capital for investments decreased.

Geopolitical shifts in the Mediterranean also contributed to the economic changes. The decline of the Byzantine Empire disrupted trade routes, and new political powers emphasized religious and ethnic loyalty over commercial ties, slowing the movement of goods and services.

There was a lack of significant advancements in agricultural technology since the eleventh century. Farming practices remained the same, but with a larger population to feed, little surplus remained. Food production neared subsistence levels, and occasional low yields exposed the precarious balance between population and food supply. Tenant farmers struggled to pay rents and landlords relied on urban financiers for credit. The failure of agriculture to keep up with the growing population did not become a crisis until the fourteenth century, but clear signs of the problem had already emerged by the middle of the thirteenth century.

Furthermore, governments became entangled in a credit crisis, and bank failures and commercial collapses became prominent. Large-scale migration of rural populations into cities also played a role.
