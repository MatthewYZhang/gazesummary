The Atlantic cod fishery thrives off the northeastern shore of North America, where a series of shallow areas called banks create a rich environment. The Grand Banks, off Newfoundland, benefit from the confluence of the Gulf Stream and Labrador Current, stirring up minerals that nourish plankton and krill, which feed herring and other small fish. Atlantic cod congregates in these waters, preying on krill and small fish.

Initially, fishers believed in the cod's inexhaustible ability to replenish itself, but in the 1930s, signs of trouble emerged as cod failed to support fishers, leading to unemployment. After an international agreement in 1977 established a 200-mile offshore fishing limit, the Canadian government aimed to revitalize Newfoundland's fishing industry and merged seafood companies into a conglomerate. However, in 1992, the Canadian government closed the Grand Banks to groundfishing due to the declining catches and closed all Atlantic cod fisheries in Canada except one. The cod fishing industry collapsed, causing about 40,000 fishers to be out of work. Currently, cod stocks remain at historically low levels, and scientists attribute the decline to decades of overfishing.
