Plant and animal life in the Pacific Islands exhibits both similarities and diversity. Islands originally connected to continents, such as New Zealand, retain remnants of earlier biota that have been modified by evolution and the arrival of new species. Islands formed by geological processes like volcanism initially lacked terrestrial life, eventually populated by seeds and animals transported by winds, ocean currents, and birds. Distribution of plants occurs mainly through birds, floating, and wind. Species diversity tends to decrease further east due to distance, smaller island size, and geographical isolation. Furthermore, the wind impacts the plant life and rain distribution, leading to ecological differences between windward and leeward sides of islands. There is relatively little biodiversity, and the smaller the island and the further east it lies, the less there is likely to be. Humans found no native mammals but noted local adaptations promoting unique species. Many environments boast endemic species, often small in number and vulnerable to disruption.
