The European Mesolithic period shows a continuous human culture adapting to environmental changes after the Ice Age. Scandinavia saw three subdivisions: the Maglemose, Kongemose, and Ertebølle periods. The Ertebølle Period, which was the culmination of Mesolithic culture in southern Scandinavia, saw Scandinavians occupying year-round coastal settlements and subsisting off a wide variety of food sources. This included forest game, waterfowl, shellfish, sea mammals, and both shallow-water and deepwater fish. Sedentary settlement brought evidence of greater social complexity in cemeteries and burial practices. Intensified resource use among hunter-gatherers of 3000 B.C. led to more marine species exploitation, productive waterfowl use, and shellfish gathering. This intensification also brought more elaborate technology, trade, settlement variety, and a rising population in southern Scandinavia. In areas like Spain, there appears to have been intensified exploitation of marine and forest resources. There was a trend nearly everywhere toward greater variety in the diet. Such societies achieved a new level of social complexity in southern Scandinavia.
