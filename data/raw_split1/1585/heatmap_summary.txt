By the close of the eighteenth century, a world economy was becoming visible, centered in Western Europe and including regions like Russia, India, and the Americas. However, the world market was confined to coasts and rivers. The expansion of economic activity into the interior was a major development of the nineteenth century, largely accomplished through advancements in transportation, especially steamships, canals, and railroads.

Sailing ships had been the main mode of economic and political expansion for centuries, reaching their peak in the mid-nineteenth century. The expansion of canal building, particularly to transport coal, was driven by the Industrial Revolution. Steamboats gained importance in the 1870s with technical progress and the completion of the Suez Canal, surpassing sailing ships in international trade. Railroad construction boomed at mid-century. The railroads spurred settlement, especially with refrigeration on railcars and steamers, which opened huge markets for perishable goods. The rise of the railroad was intertwined with the rise of the steamship, both having increasing markets and the amount of economic activity worldwide.
