The arch, most fully developed by the Romans, possesses numerous virtues, including its aesthetic appeal and ability to create large spaces without compromising structural soundness. It reduces the weight of walls and the amount of material needed. A Roman arch is a semicircle constructed from wedge-shaped stones, meeting at angles perpendicular to the curve. Its stability relies on tensions and compressions, requiring it to be complete with the keystone in place. During construction, arches need support, often from wooden frameworks.

An elegant example is the Pont du Gard in France, an aqueduct demonstrating Roman engineering skill. It functioned to transport water. The extension of an arch in depth creates a barrel vault, enabling large interior spaces. The Romanesque style adopted Roman forms of round arch and barrel vault to add height to churches. 

The round arch, while useful, had drawbacks. Its height was limited by its width. Builders didn't make light-admitting openings for fear of the arches collapsing. The pointed arch solved these problems in the Gothic period, offering a steeper angle for weight distribution and greater height. Vaults from pointed arches can be taller and do not require heavy masses of material.
