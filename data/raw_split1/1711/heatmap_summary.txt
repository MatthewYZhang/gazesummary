Refrigeration is cold storage that keeps food at temperatures between 32 and 45 degrees F to slow the growth of microorganisms that cause spoilage. This helps to maintain the original flavor, color, and nutrition of foods like meats, fish, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables. Historically, before artificial refrigeration, people used ice or snow to store perishable foods, preserving them in ice-filled pits or cold storage areas built in basements, cellars, or caves. These areas were lined with wood or straw and packed with ice, which was transported from mountains or harvested from local lakes and rivers.

Artificial refrigeration is the process of removing heat from a substance or enclosed area to lower its temperature, with the heat being moved from the inside to the outside. Refrigerators use the evaporation of a volatile liquid, or refrigerant, to absorb heat. Many refrigerators compress and pump a refrigerant through a pipe, allowing it to vaporize, losing heat and getting colder in the process.

Early artificial refrigeration efforts included William Cullen's demonstration in 1748 and Oliver Evans's refrigeration machine design in 1805. Physician John Gorrie used Evans's design to create an air-cooling apparatus in 1842. James Harrison built an ether refrigerator in 1851 after noticing the cooling effect of ether evaporation. Harrison also introduced vapor-compression refrigeration to the brewing and meatpacking industries. The brewing industry was the first in the United States to use mechanical refrigeration extensively, especially in breweries during the 1870s. Adolphus Busch used artificial refrigeration at his brewery in St. Louis, solving storage and shipping problems. Modern refrigerators operate on the same cooling principle of rapid evaporation and expansion of gases. While early refrigerators used toxic gases like ammonia and sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) later became standard, although they were eventually replaced with HFC 134a due to their harmful effects on the ozone layer.
