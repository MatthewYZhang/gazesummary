Architecture blends art and science to design spaces that serve practical and symbolic needs, reflecting cultural values and significantly shaping our environment. A building must harmonize various elements to be considered architecture, as humans instinctively seek structures that both shelter and enhance life. Buildings, created by architects, should be more than mere constructions; they should offer inspiration and delight, contribute to life by providing shelter, enriching space, complementing the site, suiting the climate, and being economically feasible. 

Technological advancements have revolutionized materials and construction methods, enabling the creation of new building materials for specific structural desires. Stone has historically been a popular material in architecture, exemplified by ancient cities like Machu Picchu. The invention of the arch was a structural innovation that allowed for greater weight support over open spaces, diverting weight to the sides, which was further developed by the Romans.
