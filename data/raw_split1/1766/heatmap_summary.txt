Life as we know it requires the presence of liquid water for chemical reactions and to transport nutrients. This requirement eliminates many worlds in our solar system. The moon and Mercury are airless and unable to support liquid water on their surfaces for extended periods. Venus has traces of water vapor in its atmosphere but is too hot for liquid water to exist.

The Jovian planets, while having moderate temperatures at certain levels, lack surfaces to nurture life's beginnings. However, a few Jovian satellites might have suitable conditions. Jupiter's moon Europa potentially has a liquid-water ocean beneath its icy crust. Saturn's moon Titan possesses an atmosphere and possibly oceans of liquid methane and ethane, but its extremely low temperature makes life unlikely.

Mars is the most promising place for life, but the evidence is not encouraging. The meteorite ALH84001, found in Antarctica, contains chemical and physical traces of ancient life on Mars, according to some scientists. However, results did not confirm the conclusion that life once existed on Mars. For instance, chemicals in the meteorite may have originated without the presence of life. Spacecraft visiting Mars may shed light on the planet's water history and present conditions, but conclusive evidence might require a geologist searching for fossils on Mars. Overall, our solar system may be devoid of life, except for Earth.
