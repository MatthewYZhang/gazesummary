Comets are interesting bodies in the solar system, composed of frozen gases like water vapor, ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, holding together rocky and metallic materials. Many travel in elongated orbits far beyond Pluto, with long-period comets taking hundreds of thousands of years to orbit the Sun. However, some short-period comets, like Halley's Comet, regularly encounter the inner solar system. As a comet nears the Sun, solar energy vaporizes the gases, creating a coma. The tail points away from the Sun due to solar forces, including radiation pressure and solar wind.

Comets originate in the outer solar system with short-period comets thought to orbit beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt and long-period comets originating from the Oort cloud. Halley's Comet, a famous short-period comet, has an orbital period of 76 years and has been recorded since 240 B.C.
