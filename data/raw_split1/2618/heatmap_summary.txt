Geologists use sediment layers to define the boundary between the Cretaceous (144-65 million years ago) and Paleocene (65-55 million years ago) periods. Sediments before 65 million years ago are rich in calcium carbonate, due to microscopic algae fossils, while sediments after contain less calcium carbonate and no mollusk fossils. Dinosaur fossils disappear in continental sediments after this time.
Scientists have proposed various theories for the rapid disappearance of dinosaurs. One theory suggests cosmic-ray particles from a supernova caused genetic changes, which would be effective if the earth's magnetosphere was weakened.
 Another theory that remains under consideration postulates that the extinction of the dinosaurs corresponds to a period of intense volcanic activity. The Deccan plateau in India, basalt rocks cover more than 500, 000 square kilometers, and correspond to massive lava outflows occurring precisely at the end of the Cretaceous. The volcanic convulsion that buried the Deccan plateau in lava must also have changed the composition of the atmosphere and severely affected climate, leading to strong sudden cooling. However, a long period of strong volcanic activity would have added a substantial amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, reinforcing the greenhouse effect.
