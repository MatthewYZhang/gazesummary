The evolutionary history of flowering plants (angiosperms) remains largely a mystery, despite extensive research into fossilized remains and modern plant characteristics. Scientists have struggled to reach a consensus on the ancestral type of plant and the timing and location of angiosperm evolution, leading Charles Darwin to term their origin an "abominable mystery." While it's generally accepted that flowering plants are monophyletic, deriving from a common ancestor, the specific identity of that ancestor is debated. Some propose a cycad-like ancestor, while others point to seed-bearing ferns or relatives of modern pines.

The earliest angiosperms, resembling modern magnolias, appeared during the Early Cretaceous period and rapidly increased in abundance. The analysis of the geographic distribution of early Cretaceous angiosperm fossils suggests a tropical origin with subsequent migration poleward, supported by finds in eastern South America and western Africa, regions that were once connected as Gondwanaland. However, alternative views exist, highlighting the prevalence of primitive flowering plants in the South Pacific, including Fiji and New Caledonia. Recent genetic research suggests that the rare tropical shrub Amborella, found only in New Caledonia, is the living plant most closely related to the angiosperm ancestor. Furthermore, fossils discovered in China from the Jurassic period may suggest an origin in northern Asia.
