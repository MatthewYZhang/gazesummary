Early cinema evolved from the initial "peepshow" format, where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater, enabling mass consumption. The Kinetoscope, Thomas Edison's peepshow device, was introduced to the public in 1894, designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors or arcades. These parlors contained only a few individual machines, allowing only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at a time. The first Kinetoscope parlors had five machines, costing customers 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine) to watch five different films.

Modeled on phonograph parlors, Kinetoscope arcades had proven successful for Edison. Edison prioritized Kinetoscope sales ($1,000 apiece) over films ($10-$15 each) and refused to develop projection technology. Exhibitors, aiming to maximize profits, turned to projection, showing films to hundreds simultaneously for 25-50 cents admission. Showmen like Louis and Auguste Lumiere and Thomas Armat perfected projection devices, utilizing them in vaudeville theaters and local town halls. Projection's advent transformed movies into the ultimate mass consumption form, contrasting with live performances. Early exhibitors mixed films with other entertainment, but their creative control was limited. The lifelike reproduction of motion and the magic of trick photography captured audiences' attention. With projection, viewing became a public experience, expanding the image size from peepshow dimensions to life-size proportions.
