Robins migrate either north or south based on the hemisphere they inhabit, and they often return to the same locations. How they navigate has been a question that intrigued researchers until Gustave Kramer provided some answers in the 1950s. Kramer's research focuses on how animals orient and navigate, with orientation defined as facing in the right direction and navigation as finding one's way from point A to point B.

Kramer found that caged migratory birds become restless around their normal migration time and often launched themselves in the direction of their migratory route. He discovered that birds use the position of the Sun for orientation, demonstrated by experiments where altering the perceived position of the Sun with mirrors changed their orientation. Additionally, experiments with artificial suns revealed that birds compensate for the Sun's movement, indicating the presence of a biological clock. Finally, night-migrating birds orient themselves according to the stars, as shown in planetarium experiments where birds adjusted their direction when the artificial sky was rotated. Birds navigate by using a variety of environmental cues, including magnetism, landmarks, coastlines, sonar, and smells.
