While England and Germany industrialized in the eighteenth century, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden developed later and lagged behind considerably in the early nineteenth century. However, these nations industrialized rapidly in the second half of the century, and they overcame their later start and lack of coal, which was the main reason they were not among the early industrializers.
Location was an important factor because they had immediate access to the sea. The Netherlands had difficulty in developing good harbors suitable for steamships but eventually did so at Rotterdam and Amsterdam, with exceptional results for transit trade with Germany and central Europe and for the processing of overseas foodstuffs and raw materials. Denmark also had an admirable commercial history with respect to traffic through the Sound.
All four countries followed a liberal trade policy. In Denmark and Sweden agricultural reforms resulted in a new class of peasant landowners with a definite market orientation.
The key factor in the success of these countries was their ability to adapt to the international division of labor. In Sweden exports accounted for 18 percent of the national income in 1870, and in 1913, 22 percent of a much larger national income. In the early twentieth century, Denmark exported 63 percent of its agricultural production.
