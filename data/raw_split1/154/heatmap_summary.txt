China boasts one of the world's oldest continuous civilizations, deeply rooted in a complex social and visual history where pottery and porcelain play significant roles. The evolution of ceramics in China saw the emergence of high-temperature stonewares with glazed surfaces as early as the 15th century B.C. By the Six Dynasties period, kilns in northern China were producing high-fired ceramics of considerable quality. The highly prized porcelains of the Song Dynasty emerged from whitewares produced in Hebei and Henan provinces. Trade with the West during the settled and prosperous Chinese dynasties brought new forms and technologies, as evidenced by the admiration for ninth-century A.D. Chinese porcelain wares in the Arab world. These wares prompted the creation of imitations and sparked research into their manufacturing methods. Similarly, the Chinese acquired a blue pigment and, influenced by the Dutch East India Company, vast quantities of decorated porcelain were brought to Europe, influencing wares such as Delft. The meaning of Chinese pottery, like painted designs on Greek pots, has cultural significance; elements such as dragons, phoenixes, pomegranates, and various animals symbolize different aspects such as power, fertility, and success.
