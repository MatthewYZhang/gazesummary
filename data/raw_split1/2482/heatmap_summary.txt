Nineteenth-century geology grappled with the origin of mountains, with terrestrial contraction being a primary explanation. The idea was that Earth formed hot and cooled over time, causing contraction and deformation, thus creating mountains. Eduard Suess popularized Earth as a drying apple, where the crust broke as the interior shrank, forming ocean basins and continents which became unstable and collapsed to form new ocean floors.

The interchange of continents and oceans explained perplexing geological observations, such as marine fossils on land and similarities in fossils across Africa and South America. Suess attributed this to an early supercontinent called Gondwanaland.  In North America, James Dwight Dana developed permanence theory, suggesting continents formed early and cooled and contracted to form ocean basins.  As the earth continued to contract, its surface began to deform. James Hall linked permanence theory to subsidence of sedimentary basins, and Dana argued thick sedimentary piles were the result of subsidence, explaining shallow-water rocks' accumulation.
