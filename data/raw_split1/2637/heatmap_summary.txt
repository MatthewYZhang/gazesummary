Wet rice farming is the most productive of all preindustrial intensive agricultural systems, typically involving flooding fields for the majority of the growing season. The source of water can be natural rainfall or artificial irrigation, with wet rice often grown on floodplains or terraced hillsides. A remarkable feature is the ability of a plot to yield a harvest year after year, requiring little to no fallow periods, allowing for continuous cultivation and even multiple harvests. The high water table and water provide protection from erosion, reduction in nutrient leaching, replacement of soil nutrients, and nitrogen fixation. However, wet rice farmers must manage water effectively, requiring organized cooperative labor patterns and water rights. The water level must be controlled fairly precisely, and the land must be leveled, requiring low dikes.  The consumption of water must be coordinated to maintain public irrigation works, while poor families must share water rights of access to one plot with other families.
