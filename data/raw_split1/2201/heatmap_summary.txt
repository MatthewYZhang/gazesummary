The European economy began to slow around 1300 after three centuries of gains. A key factor was a shift in climate as the fair weather of previous centuries worsened. Temperature declined by approximately two degrees Celsius, which shortened growing seasons and affected crop resilience. This led to declining crop yields and a contraction in the agricultural economy. Dwindling food supplies caused rising costs, impacting capital available for other purchases or investments.

Changes in the geopolitics of the Mediterranean also played a role. The decline of the Byzantine Empire disrupted trade routes to central and eastern Asia, and new political powers emerged. European interest in circumnavigating Africa originated from a desire to avoid the roadblock in the eastern Mediterranean and directly tap into the trade with eastern Asia.  Additionally, there were few technological changes in agriculture since the eleventh century, and food production fell close to subsistence levels. Tenant farmers, unable to pay their rents, began to slip into debt. Many governments became entangled in credit crisis, with the Bardi and Peruzzi banks of Florence collapsing.
