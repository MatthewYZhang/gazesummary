Geothermal energy is derived from Earth's internal heat, fueled by radioactivity, which powers plate tectonics, continental drift, mountain building, and earthquakes. This energy can be harnessed to drive electric generators and heat homes. Geothermal energy becomes available when underground heat is transferred by water as it passes through a subsurface region of hot rocks, often hundreds or thousands of feet deep. The water is naturally occurring groundwater that seeps down along fractures in the rock, or less typically, it is artificially introduced by being pumped down from the surface. The most abundant form of geothermal energy is found at relatively low temperatures between 80° to 180° centigrade, where water circulated through heat reservoirs can extract enough heat to warm spaces. Over 20,000 apartments in France are heated by underground water from the Paris Basin. Geothermal energy is not renewable. However, geothermal energy can make important local contributions only where the resource is close to the user and the economics are favorable, as they are in California, New Zealand, and Iceland.
