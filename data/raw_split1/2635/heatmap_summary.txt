Solar energy that reaches Earth causes differential heating of the atmosphere, resulting in air circulation and wind. Some of this energy is transferred to the oceans, causing waves and partly oceanic currents. Gravitational attraction between Earth and the Sun and Moon generates tides, which, along with Earthâ€™s rotation, cause twice-daily sea level changes. Harnessing ocean energy could provide a limitless, nonpolluting energy source, but it is diffuse and challenging to concentrate.

Ocean water at depth can be much colder than surface water, which allows for ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), and there must also be a coastal region where water can be stored following high tide. Tidal power may be the most promising form of ocean energy and has been used for centuries in some coastal areas to run mills, although its use at present for electrical generation is limited. One limitation is that the tidal range must be at least five meters, and there must also be a coastal region where water can be stored following high tide. Suitable sites for using tidal power are limited not only by tidal range but also by location.
