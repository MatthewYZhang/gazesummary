In the early twentieth century, American architecture aimed for a style rooted in the American landscape. Mary Colter and Frank Lloyd Wright endorsed an American architecture, developing regional styles that paralleled the regionalism seen in other visual arts. Colter created a uniquely Southwestern idiom incorporating desert landscapes with Native American arts, while Wright developed the Prairie style reflecting the natural landscape of the Midwest.

Wright believed that architecture was an extension of the natural environment, designing mostly homes in the country and being associated with the Prairie style. He nestled his house in the brow of a hill and gave it the name Taliesin, which means “shining brow” in Welsh. Every element of the design corresponded to the surounding landscape. Wright’s most famous house, Falling Water，was built right over a waterfall in Pennsylvania. The house blends harmoniously with its surroundings, yet it departs from the Prairie philosophy of being a completely integrated extension of the natural landscape.
