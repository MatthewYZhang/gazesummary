The American dream was re-defined and reinvigorated in northern California when an accidental discovery near the American River changed the nation. After 1848, the new dream was to make a fortune, with rumors of gold resonating and many risking everything. Whispers of a gold strike spread eastward, with President James Polk's validation enthralling millions. People abandoned their lives to head for California, fueled by newspaper reports of abundant gold.

By 1849, gold fever became epidemic, with foreigners such as Chinese, Chileans, Mexicans, Irish, Germans, French and Turks coming to seek fortune, dubbed "Forty-Niners." Overland travelers braved dangerous routes with mountains, deserts, and bandits. Soon miners began to band together to dam rivers and expose gold. As accessible deposits depleted, the loose knit groups of miners were replaced by corporations. 

The mining corporations developed extraction techniques that were both frightfully efficient and frightfully destructive that destroyed the rivers and caused California's first environmental disasters, the most damaging of the large scale mining techniques came in 1853 with the advent of hydraulic mining. By the 1860s, hydraulic mining was destroying the landscape, but few voices were raised in protest. Mining companies exploited the land for profit, with little regard for environmental devastation.
