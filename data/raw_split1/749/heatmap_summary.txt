Cities are generally warmer than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island. This temperature difference influences air pollution concentration, so it is important to understand how the heat island forms. The urban heat island is largely attributed to industrial and urban development. In rural areas, solar energy is used to evaporate water from vegetation and soil. In cities, less vegetation and exposed soil exist, leading to a majority of the Sunâ€™s energy being absorbed by urban structures and asphalt. This results in reduced evaporative cooling and higher surface temperatures in cities. The albedo, surface roughness, heat and moisture emissions contribute to the urban heat island effect. The effect is most significant at night, during winter, and under high-pressure conditions. The presence of pollutants in the city environment also affects climate. The pollutants reduce visibility and increase the frequency of city fog. Precipitation may be greater in cities, aided by city heat, which warms surface air and enhances rising air motions, leading to cloud and thunderstorm formation.
