Literacy appeared independently, with the earliest writing evidenced by the cuneiform Sumerian script on ancient Mesopotamia's clay tablets. The script originated from accounting practices for commercial activity. Preliterate people used clay tokens as symbolic representations of products to track goods, evolving into wedge-shaped cuneiform signs.

The original tokens, dating to circa 8500 B.C.E., were three-dimensional shapes like spheres, cones, disks, and cylinders. A debt of six units of grain and eight head of livestock might be represented by conical and cylindrical tokens, respectively. To keep batches of tokens together, they were sealed inside clay envelopes. Two-dimensional representations of the tokens were then impressed on the envelopes, which later eliminated tokens.

The token-and-envelope system invariably represented small-scale transactions. The evidence of tokens provides further confirmation that mathematics originated in peopleâ€™s desire to keep records of flocks and other goods.  The accountants, however, devised numeral signs distinct from commodity signs. Their invention of abstract numerals and abstract counting was one of the most revolutionary advances in the history of mathematics. The scribal class kept accounts on clay tablets.
