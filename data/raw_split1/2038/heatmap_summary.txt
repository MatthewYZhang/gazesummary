Pest control is a necessity as certain pest species, particularly nonindigenous ones like brown rats and cockroaches, cannot be eradicated. Thus, control measures are implemented to manage their populations. Chemical methods, though ancient and popular, have a dark side. Pesticides impact not only target species but also nontarget species, disrupting food webs and suppressing native predators.

The use of nonindigenous predators as biological controls can be effective but possesses inherent dangers and must be assessed carefully. For example, the cactus-eating moth, introduced to Australia to control prickly pear, eventually threatened native prickly pear species in Florida.

To address these challenges, entomologists have developed Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a holistic approach that considers various aspects and employs a variety of techniques to control pests. IPM prioritizes early intervention and relies on natural mortality factors such as weather and natural enemies. Successful IPM requires knowledge of pest ecology, field monitoring, and flexible control measures.
