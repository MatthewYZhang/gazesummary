Domestication of wild species led to denser human populations by yielding more food. Societies possessing domestic animals used livestock to feed more people by providing meat, milk, fertilizer, and plowing. Large domestic animals replaced wild game as the main source of animal protein, providing wool, leather, and land transport. Humans have domesticated few species of large animals, defined as weighing over 100 pounds. Fourteen such species were domesticated before the twentieth century, and five of the most important are sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle. Small animals such as ducks, geese, rabbits, dogs, cats, mink, bees, and silkworms have been domesticated for food, clothing, or warmth, but do not pull plows or wagons. Domestication involves transforming wild animals into something more useful to humans through human selection and evolutionary responses. To be domesticated, a wild species must possess several characteristics, including being primarily a herbivore because it takes less plant biomass to feed a plant eater. A candidate must also weigh over 100 pounds and grow quickly. Animals cannot have a disposition that is nasty, dangerous, or unpredictable. Almost all domesticated large mammals share characteristics such as living in a herd, maintaining a dominance hierarchy, and having herds that occupy overlapping home ranges.
