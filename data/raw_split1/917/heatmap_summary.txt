One of the first observers to surmise a long age for Earth was the Greek historian Herodotus, who observed the Nile River Delta and noted that individual floods deposit only thin layers of sediment, leading him to conclude that the Delta had taken thousands of years to build up. This notion that one could estimate ages of geologic features by determining rates of the processes responsible for such features was significant. Later centuries saw similar applications of this concept to estimate the ages of rock formations and layers of sediment that had compacted and cemented to form sedimentary rocks.

Later, attempts were made again to understand clues to Earth's history through the rock record. Geologists tried to determine rates of sedimentation to estimate the age of Earth from the sedimentary record, though these estimates underestimated the actual age because much of the record is missing. The discovery of radioactivity opened the door to determining both the Sunâ€™s energy source and the age of Earth, leading to the realization that Earth must be billions of years old and that nuclear fusion sustains the Sun's luminosity. By the 1960s, analysis of meteorites and refinements of solar evolution models converged on an age for the solar system, and hence for Earth, of 4.5 billion years.
