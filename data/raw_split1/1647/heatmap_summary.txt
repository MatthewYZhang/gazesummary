Cloud formation occurs when water vapor condenses or deposits, becoming visible as water droplets or ice crystals. Clouds are aggregates of these tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere, indicating condensation and deposition of water vapor. Laboratory studies show that clean air requires supersaturated conditions for condensation. Humid air cools, often by convection, causing rising air currents. As the air rises, it expands and cools, reaching its dew point where water vapor condenses into droplets, forming what we see as clouds.

Clouds exhibit various forms due to atmospheric processes, with changes in clouds providing clues about future weather. British naturalist Luke Howard developed a cloud classification system in 1803. Clouds are grouped as heaped clouds, resulting from rising unstable air, or layered clouds, resulting from stable air. They are also classified by appearance—cumulus, stratus, and cirrus—altitude, and precipitation.

Cumulus clouds are dense, white, heaped clouds with cauliflower-like domes formed by convection, while stratus clouds are layered, spreading horizontally like blankets. Cirrus clouds, found at high altitudes, appear as delicate white filaments, strands, or hooks, made of ice crystals. Viewed from the ground, they often emerge from a single point and spread across the sky, with their fibrous appearance caused by wind-stretched ice particles.
