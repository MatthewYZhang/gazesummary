Frank Lloyd Wright, a striking figure in early twentieth-century architecture, aimed to create an "architecture of democracy."  Believing in architecture as "natural" and "organic," he envisioned it as serving free individuals within a "free" space, designed nonsymmetrically to interact with natural surroundings. Central to Wright's view was continuity, rejecting fixation and integrating walls, ceilings, and floors.

Wright's work in the early twentieth century featured cross-axial plans and continuous roof planes, defining a new domestic architecture. The Robie House, built between 1907 and 1909, exemplified these concepts as a "prairie house," featuring long, sweeping, ground-hugging lines that captured the expansiveness of the Midwest's flatlands.  Wright eliminated facades, extended roofs, and concealed entrances. He filled the Robie House with intricately joined spaces around a central fireplace, including enclosed patios, overhanging roofs, and strip windows that blur the boundaries between interior and exterior.

Wright's "naturalism" is evident in the Robie House, where he adjusted the building to its site. In contrast, the Kaufmann House, known as "Fallingwater," perches on a rocky hillside over a waterfall. Since its completion, the public has marveled at the interplay between the interior and exterior. Wright built the house over the waterfall to ensure that its inhabitants could fully experience its power.

Wright's architecture emphasized space designed to fit the patron's life. In the late 1930s, he aimed to provide good architectural design for smaller dwellings. His plans, published in Europe, particularly in Holland and Germany, and exhibited in Berlin in 1910, inspired younger architects.
