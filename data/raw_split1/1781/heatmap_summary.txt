The conventional view of Upper Paleolithic societies has been challenged by new research focusing on the critical role of women in the food-foraging economy. Researchers like Soffer, Adovasio, and Hyland have amassed previously overlooked evidence from Dolní Věstonice and Pavlov, suggesting that human survival depended more on women, plants, and net hunting than on men hunting big game. Soffer highlights that net hunting is communal, involving the labor of children and women, challenging the image of "Upper Paleolithic macho guys."

The use of net hunting in historical societies, where women play a key role, is observed by researchers. In the Congo, net hunting Mbuti capture game every time, netting 50 percent of the animals encountered. The nets were more valuable than bows and arrows, and the catch was smoked or dried. Soffer suspects that the inhabitants of Dolní Věstonice and Pavlov were not the only ones who made nets. Despite not knowing everything about their activities, the women played important roles in Ice Age Europe, which changes how we see the past.
