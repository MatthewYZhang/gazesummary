Petroleum, consisting of crude oil and natural gas, seems to originate from organic matter in marine sediment. Microscopic organisms settle to the seafloor and accumulate in marine mud. The organic matter may partially decompose, using up the dissolved oxygen in the sediment. As soon as the oxygen is gone, decay stops and the remaining organic matter is preserved. Continued sedimentation—the process of deposits’ settling on the sea bottom—buries the organic matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures, which convert the organic matter to oil and gas. Both oil and gas are less dense than water, so they generally tend to rise upward through water-saturated rock and sediment. When an oil pool or field has been discovered, wells are drilled into the ground. Water or steam may be pumped down adjacent wells to help push the oil out. There is far more oil underground than can be recovered.  Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks or other public lands. Finally, the refining and burning of petroleum and its products can cause air pollution.
