Photographic evidence indicates that liquid water once existed on Mars, with two types of flow features: runoff and outflow channels. Runoff channels are extensive systems in the southern highlands, resembling Earth's river systems and suggesting they were dried-up beds of rivers that once carried rainfall. These channels indicate a time 4 billion years ago when Mars had a thicker atmosphere, a warmer surface, and widespread liquid water. Outflow channels are likely relics of catastrophic flooding and are found in equatorial regions. The water from these floods likely formed teardrop-shaped islands, and the flow rates were enormous, possibly a hundred times greater than the Amazon river.

Scientists believe Mars may have had rivers, lakes, and even oceans. The Hellas Basin may also have been an ancient Martian sea. Evidence supporting these ideas includes terraced "beaches" that could have been left behind by evaporating lakes or oceans, though detractors believe they could have been created by geological activity. Despite these features, Mars Global Surveyor data indicate a lack of carbonate rock layers, which would have formed in an ancient ocean. Nevertheless, some data suggest liquid water existed on Mars in the past. The outflow channels suggest a huge volume of water existed on Mars. It is believed this water is now locked in permafrost under the surface, with more in the polar caps.
