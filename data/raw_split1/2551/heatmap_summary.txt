Paleontologists have debated that climatic alterations caused the demise of the dinosaurs. The Cretaceous climate was milder than today's, with shallow seas buffering the temperature. At the end of the Cretaceous, these seaways retreated, causing climates to become more extreme. Dinosaurs may not have been able to tolerate these changes. The geological record shows a thin layer of clay between the Cretaceous and Cenozoic layers, leading scientists to investigate the element iridium (Ir) within it. Ir is found in high concentrations in meteorites, allowing scientists to estimate how long it would take to deposit the observed amount in the clay, and other evidence suggest that the deposition of the boundary clay could not have taken one million years. The unusually high concentration of Ir seems to require a special explanation. Scientists hypothesized that a large asteroid collided with Earth, creating a dust cloud that cut off sunlight, decreased temperatures, caused acid rain, and raised long-term global temperatures, eradicating the dinosaurs.
