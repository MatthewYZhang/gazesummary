Scientists have a good understanding of the physical laws and mathematical equations that govern atoms in the air, oceans, and land, yet weather prediction remains challenging. The assumption that more weather stations and powerful computers would solve this issue has proven incorrect, as weather is fundamentally unpredictable beyond a few weeks due to the butterfly effect. Weather prediction requires understanding current weather conditions and how they change over time.

To illustrate, consider predicting a car's location, which requires knowing its current position and speed. Similarly, predicting weather involves specifying current conditions like temperature, pressure, cloud cover, and wind in a model world, along with the equations that govern their changes. Running a weather model for New York City may predict warm weather and a storm later. Making a small change in the initial conditions, such as wind speed in Brazil, may not affect tomorrow's prediction but can significantly alter next month's forecast because the laws governing weather can cause tiny changes in initial conditions to be greatly magnified over time.

This sensitivity to initial conditions is called the butterfly effect, where a small change can lead to very different predictions. The butterfly effect is a hallmark of chaotic systems. Chaotic systems are described by nonlinear equations, which allow for subtler and more intricate interactions. Many chaotic systems have a kind of underlying order that explains the general features of their behavior even while details at any particular moment remain unpredictable.
