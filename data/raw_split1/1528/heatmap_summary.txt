General systems theory employs the word "system" to describe interconnected components with functional relationships. The formal characteristics of systems are similar across all sciences, and the discipline formulates principles valid for systems in general. Systems are divided into closed and open types. A closed system receives no external energy and transfers none outwards, while an open system receives energy from its surroundings and transfers it out again. A closed system is isolated from its surroundings, and its energy supply is limited and progressively depleted. Without external energy, the system's processes cease. However, the earth system as a whole is a closed system. The boundary of the Earth system is the outer edge of the atmosphere, and except for the occasional meteorite, virtually no mass is exchanged between the Earth system and the rest of the universe.

In contrast, an open system exchanges energy and mass with its surroundings, exemplified by living organisms that absorb and release energy. Open systems are part of larger systems. The natural environment consists of open systems that can behave temporarily as closed systems when their energy supply is halted. The water systems receive their energy supply from the Earth’s heat budget, which in turn receives its energy supply from the sun’s radiation.
