In Britain, the Industrial Revolution brought a dramatic change by harnessing power, moving beyond the limitations of animal or human muscles, wind, and running water, the primary sources until the reign of George III. While waterpower was abundant in Lancashire and Scotland, its reliance on natural streams and seasonal variations posed a significant disadvantage, making it hard to be located on their banks. The need for a new, constant power source was evident.
The source was known but not exploited. An early eighteenth-century pump used expanding steam to raise a piston in a cylinder, with atmospheric pressure causing it to descend as the steam condensed into a vacuum. Although Thomas Savery’s “atmospheric engine” was improved by Thomas Newcomen, it remained slow and fuel-inefficient, limiting its use to coal mines. James Watt enhanced the steam engine in the 1760s, perfecting a separate condenser to eliminate the need to cool the cylinder for each stroke and devising a method to convert reciprocating motion into rotary motion. This transformation turned an inefficient pump into a versatile steam engine that liberated industry from dependence on running water.

Later, the engine eliminated water in the mines by driving efficient pumps, which made possible deeper mining.
