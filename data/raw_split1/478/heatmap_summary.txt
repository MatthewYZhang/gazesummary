Competition arises when individuals of the same or different species rely on the same limited resource. It was described in detail by Darwin. Intraspecies competition is a major component of natural selection in evolutionary biology, while interspecies competition significantly impacts ecology, influencing population sizes and potentially leading to the extinction of species, as seen when European species outcompeted indigenous species in New Zealand. The effects of competition are graphically demonstrated when all the animals or all the plants in an ecosystem come into competition, as happened when North and South American species migrated to each other.

Competition's influence on a community's composition and species density is controversial, often inferred from species spread or decline. Gause's experiments showed one species extinct when only one resource was available, leading to the competitive exclusion principle. Also, the evolutionary effect of competition on species has been referred to as “species selection”. Competition may occur for any needed resource, and the more severe the denser the population.
