Our solar system is a huge rotating system with the Sun as its hub. The Sun contains an estimated 99.85 percent of the solar system's mass. The planets are categorized into terrestrial (Earth-like) and Jovian (Jupiter-like) types. The Jovian planets are often called giants and are known as the outer planets because of their locations. The terrestrial planets include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, while the Jovian planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto's great distance from Earth and its small size make its true nature a mystery. The most obvious difference between the terrestrial and the Jovian planets is their size. Jupiter's primordial cloud of dust and gas is hypothesized to have had a composition somewhat similar to Jupiter's. However, unlike Jupiter, the terrestrial planets are nearly void of light gases and ices today, possibly because they were once larger and richer in these materials but lost them due to their closeness to the Sun.
