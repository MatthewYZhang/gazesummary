In 1970, geologists Kenneth J. Hsu and William B.F. Ryan aimed to resolve questions about the Mediterranean's geologic history, focusing on the abrupt changes in its invertebrate fauna around 6 million years ago, a period that saw the near extinction of most older organisms, the survival of a few hardy species, and subsequent migrations to and from the Atlantic. Another task was determining the origin of domelike masses beneath the seafloor, especially the presence of extensive solid crystalline salt layers, akin to those found along the U.S. Gulf Coast. 

To this end, on August 23, 1970, the scientists aboard the Glomar Challenger recovered a sample comprised of hardened sediment pebbles, deep-sea mud, gypsum granules, and volcanic rock fragments. They hypothesized that around 20 million years ago, the Mediterranean was connected to the Atlantic by narrow straits, which crustal movements closed, leading to evaporation and increased salinity that exterminated many invertebrate species. Evaporation then resulted in calcium sulfate precipitation. Later, the Mediterranean was a vast desert before the Strait of Gibraltar opened, causing water to flow back in, breaking up salt flats into pebbles. Normal marine life returned, and oceanic ooze accumulated.
