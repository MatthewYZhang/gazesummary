Before microscopes were available, no one understood that living organisms were composed of cells. The first microscopes were light microscopes, which work by passing visible light through a specimen, magnifying the image. Magnification, the increase in apparent size, is crucial in microscopy. Resolving power, the clarity of an image, is also important; it's the ability of an optical instrument to show two objects as separate. Because of resolving power, the light microscope is limited and cannot resolve detail finer than 0.2 micrometers. Biologists use the scanning electron microscope to study the detailed architecture of cell surfaces. It scans the surface of a cell or group of cells that have been coated with metal by using an electron beam. When the metal is hit by the beam, it emits electrons. These electrons are focused to form an image of the outside of the cells, producing three-dimensional images.
