Crop engineering is preceded by a long history of genetic manipulation in agriculture, beginning with human impact and its effects at tropical and subtropical sites. Early humans, omnivores consuming various plant and animal materials, significantly altered the environment, driving animal species to extinction, and spreading plants as they migrated. This includes accidentally distributing seeds as they migrated. These early domesticated crops set the stage for later changes in agriculture.

The recognition that seeds could offer a stable food source spurred agriculture, with plants observed growing from refuse or wasteland, such as fruit trees along jungle paths and vegetables in garbage dumps. Around eight to ten thousand years ago, more structured agriculture emerged in several global locations. The simplest way to select crops is to save seeds preferentially from plants with beneficial traits. Early farmers selected for larger seeds and fruit, increased seed production, faster germination, higher yield, and less seed scattering. This early selection led to an accelerating impact on crop diversity and distribution. The third factor in agriculture is the increased precision in crop selection and breeding. This stems from advances and the work of Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel.
