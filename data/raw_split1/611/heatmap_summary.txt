Between 800 and 500 B.C. the rise of the polis, or city-state, led to the development of governmental systems appropriate to their circumstances. Athens saw a struggle for political power between the aristocracy and emerging classes, leading to an adjustment of lifestyles and a classical Athenian culture. Athens had traditional institutions of adult male assemblies, aristocratic councils, and elected officials.  Between 600 and 450 B.C. the Athenians developed what Greeks regarded as a full democratic constitution. Solon weakened the aristocracy in 594 B.C. by basing office holding on wealth rather than birth, abolishing economic obligations, and enabling the assembly to overrule courts.  The strength of the Athenian aristocracy was weakened during the rest of the century by the rise of a government known as a tyranny. Cleisthenes contributed to democracy by weakening family structures and establishing locality-based corporations called demes. The effect of Cleisthenes' reforms was to establish the superiority of the Athenian community.
