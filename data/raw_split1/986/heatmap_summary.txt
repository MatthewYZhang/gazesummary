Direct species translocation is becoming increasingly common, with conservationists moving animals or entire species to new sites either to establish new populations or to reinforce existing ones. This technique, used on various plants and animals, has seen a rapid increase under the banner of conservation, leading to both its wider use and criticisms of its efficacy and potential drawbacks. Translocations range from organized programs to ad hoc releases by animal lovers and can play an effective role in conservation strategies by increasing the size, genetic diversity, and demographic balance of populations.

However, there's surprisingly little evidence of its efficacy, partly due to the lack of scientific rigor in many translocations and the difficulty in defining success. To address this, a general framework is needed to ensure justification, realistic success chances, proper monitoring, and evaluation for future efforts. The Seychelles warbler translocation serves as an example of success, where individuals were moved to reduce risk, resulting in healthy breeding populations. But success stories are matched by accounts of failure, suggesting that many projects have not demonstrated success.
