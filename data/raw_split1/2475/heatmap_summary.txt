Initially, air was viewed as a receptacle for airborne particles, exhibiting diverse chemical properties, as understood by John Mayow. Despite Mayow and others detecting specific properties in gases like carbon dioxide, chemists largely overlooked them until the 18th century. Although chemists became aware of the atmosphere's role in combustion and respiration, they attributed these reactions to substances that air could absorb and release, rather than to air's inherent chemical properties, viewing air as a physical environment for reactions.

In the early 1700s, “air” and “the air” were considered identical, with chemists focusing on solids and liquids due to the lack of methods for examining air. Chemists emphasized chemical qualities over physical ones, leaving the study of air's weight to physicists. However, by the time of the Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert, this perspective started to shift with the invention of the pneumatic trough by Reverend Stephen Hales, which facilitated the handling of air.

Hales, a botanist and chemist, urged chemists to consider air chemically and described an instrument for washing air produced during reactions, which passed air through water. By happenstance, the apparatus also served as an instrument for capturing and holding air. It became a staple in chemical laboratories and essential for incorporating the gaseous state into chemistry, enabling the study of gases and the demonstration that gases could contain diverse chemical substances. Hales had shown that air could be contained, washed, purified, and tested, but he didn't realize there was more than one kind of air.
