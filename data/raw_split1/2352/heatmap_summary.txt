The problem of narrative clarity in silent films arose as American filmmaking became more storytelling-focused around 1904, especially with the rise of one-reel films. Filmmakers sought ways to use techniques like editing, camerawork, acting, and lighting to clarify film narratives and ensure that audiences understood where and when actions took place. Eventually, filmmakers developed a system of formal principles that was standard in American filmmaking by 1917, later known as classical Hollywood cinema.

One key challenge was the audience's difficulty in understanding causal, spatial, and temporal relationships in films. A film review from 1906 highlighted this issue, noting that some films were technically good but failed to consider the audience's perspective. To address this, filmmakers aimed to guide the spectator's attention and ensure every aspect of the story was clear. Films increasingly established cause-and-effect chains, where events were driven by character beliefs and desires.

Editing played a crucial role in telling stories, allowing filmmakers to move between spaces or zoom in on details. However, if viewers lost track of the temporal or spatial relationships between shots, editing could lead to confusion, intertitles and visual cues were used to emphasize continuity and orient the viewer.
