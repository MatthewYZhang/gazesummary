Photographic evidence suggests liquid water once existed on Mars. There are runoff and outflow channels. Runoff channels are found in the southern highlands, forming extensive, interconnecting systems resembling Earth's river systems. Geologists think these are dried-up riverbeds from a time when rainfall carried water from mountains to valleys, roughly 4 billion years ago when the atmosphere was thicker, the surface warmer, and water widespread.

Outflow channels are relics of catastrophic flooding, mainly in equatorial regions and are paths for vast amounts of water draining from the southern highlands to the northern plains. The flood waters formed teardrop-shaped islands similar to those on beaches. The flow rates were much larger than the Amazon River. Some scientists speculate that Mars once had rivers, lakes, and perhaps oceans. A 2003 Mars Global Surveyor image shows a delta in the southern highlands, suggesting a river flowed into a lake. Other researchers think that the data provide evidence for large open bodies of water on the early Martian surface. Despite controversy, some evidence suggests past water activity on Mars. The water that once existed on Mars might now be trapped in the permafrost layer beneath the surface and in the planet's polar caps.
