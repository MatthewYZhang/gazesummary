Raccoons have a vast distribution throughout most of North America and Central America. They are found from southern Canada all the way to Panama, as well as on islands near coastal areas, and they occur in each of the 49 states of the continental United States. Raccoons are native only to the Western Hemisphere, but they have been transplanted to other parts of the globe. After a population decline to a relatively low level in the 1930s, raccoons began to prosper following their 1943 breeding season. The rapid population surge continued throughout the 1940s, and high numbers have been sustained ever since. By the late 1980s, the number of raccoons in North America was estimated to be at least 15 to 20 times the number that existed during the 1930s. Their spread throughout the Rocky Mountain West is indicative of the fast pace at which they can exploit new environments. The expansion of agriculture may also contribute to raccoon abundance, as they have been able to exploit crops, especially corn and cereal grains, which have become dependable food sources. Prior to Europeans settling and farming the Great Plains Region, raccoons probably were just found along its rivers and streams and in the wooded areas of its southeastern section. With the possible exception of the southern part of the province of Manitoba, their absence was notable throughout Canada. The extermination of the wolf may have been a critical factor in the raccoon's expansion.
