In the nineteenth century, Western Europeans experienced higher living standards and longer, healthier lives due to industrialization and increased agricultural output. Europe's population surged from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900, with each region contributing at different stages of demographic change.

Improvements in the food supply continued from the late seventeenth century with new lands cultivated and the expansion of American crops, particularly the potato. Setbacks occurred, such as regional agricultural failures that caused economic recessions until 1850 and could lead to famine, a major potato blight in 1846-1847 killed one million people in Ireland and caused another million to emigrate. After 1850, the expansion of foods more regularly kept pace with population growth. The application of science and new technology to agriculture increased and Mechanization included the use of horse-drawn harvesters and seed drills, many developed initially in the United States.
