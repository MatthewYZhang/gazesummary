The rapid escalation of ice melt due to global warming is a pervasive climatic effect. Glacial ice is retreating, and Greenland's ice sheet is thinning. The additional meltwater, especially from continental ice masses and glaciers, is adding to a worldwide rise in sea level.

Numerous ice shelves surround the margins of Antarctica.  Some large sections of ice shelves have recently broken free, with examples from the Ronne Ice Shelf and the Ross Ice Shelf.  Six ice shelves have disintegrated since 1993, and the Larsen Ice Shelf along the Antarctic Peninsula has been retreating.

Significant temperature increases are being recorded to depths of more than 300 m.  Ocean warming will contribute about 25% of sea-level rise due to thermal expansion. Changes in ocean temperature affect weather and agriculture, and the ocean system has delayed some surface global warming. A quick survey of world coastlines shows that even a moderate rise could bring changes of unparalleled proportions. Particularly tragic social and economic consequences will affect small island states.
