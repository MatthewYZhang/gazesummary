Soil is a renewable resource that takes a long time to create. Agriculture has an impact on the productivity of soils over time. Lands with the highest quality are put into production first. As more land is utilized, the average quality decreases, reducing productivity. Crop production falls over time without proper management. Scientists have found that one-quarter of the world's soils have been degraded, and the rate has increased. Irrigation can increase crop yields, but it can also lead to sharp drops in crop productivity. Salinization is a critical soil problem related to irrigation, affecting a fourth of the world's irrigated cropland. Salt buildup can stunt crop growth and eventually make the land unproductive. Waterlogging often accompanies salinization, especially when farmers apply heavy amounts of irrigation water. Worldwide, at least one-tenth of all irrigated land is subject to waterlogging. Another serious soil problem is erosion, which is accelerated by poor agricultural management. Topsoil is being lost much faster than it is being replaced, reducing corn and wheat yields.
