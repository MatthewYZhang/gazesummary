The timing of flowering and seed production is influenced by a plant's physiology and environment, with flowering occurring at different times of the year. While temperature and water availability are unreliable, the length of day is a dependable cue. Longer days indicate spring and summer, while shorter days signal autumn and winter.

Plants are classified as day-neutral, long-day, or short-day, though the latter two are more accurately described by the duration of darkness. Short-night plants flower when darkness is shorter than a specific period, while long-night plants flower when darkness is longer. Plant scientists can induce flowering in the cocklebur by exposing leaves to long nights, indicating a signal transmitted to the flowering bud. Researchers are attempting to isolate this signaling molecule, florigen. To measure continuous darkness, a plant needs a metabolic clock and a light-detecting system, with light resetting the clock. A brief exposure to sunlight or white light can reset their biological clocks. The light detecting system of plants is a pigment in leaves called phytochrome, and interrupting the dark period can prevent flowering.
