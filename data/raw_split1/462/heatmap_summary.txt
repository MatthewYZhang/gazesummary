A conspicuous sign indicating the presence of white-tailed deer in a woodlot is a buck rub, which is created by a male deer striping the bark of a small, smooth-barked tree, usually a red maple, with its antlers at about shoulder height. Biologists have discovered that deer sniff and lick these rubs for communication purposes, as they play an important role in the social life of deer. The act of forehead rubbing by male deer on buck rubs leaves behind a scent produced by glands in the forehead, enabling olfactory communication between deer. The chemicals deposited on the rub provide information on the individual identity of an animal, indicate the sex of the deer producing the rub, and signal the presence of older, higher-status males in the area. Both sexes respond to buck rubs by smelling and licking, so fresher buck rubs may physiologically induce and synchronize fertility in females that visit these rubs, which would be an advantage to a socially dominant buck courting several adult females during the autumn rut. Another visual signal produced by while-tailed deer is termed a buck scrape, which involves the deer urinating in a clearing in the ground.
