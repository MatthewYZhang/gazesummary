Before the introduction of the mechanical clock in Europe, people relied on sun dials and water clocks to tell time. The sun dials were only effective on clear days, while water clocks were unreliable in freezing temperatures. Medieval Europe placed a new emphasis on reliable timekeeping. The Catholic Church required an alarm to awaken monks for prayers. Cities and towns needed to organize collective activities. Society found a more dependable time measurement instrument in the mechanical clock.

The invention of the mechanical clock spread rapidly from Italy and England. The machine tended to undermine Catholic Church authority. While church ritual had sustained an interest in timekeeping throughout the centuries of urban collapse, the mechanical clock implied a new time reckoning. Towns and cities adopted equal hours, and public clocks became symbols of secular municipal authority.

The mechanical clock was a significant achievement of medieval ingenuity. The accuracy of the clock could be checked against natural phenomena. The clock provided a basis for temporal autonomy. It enabled people to coordinate activities. The notion of productivity emerged as one could relate performance to uniform time units.
