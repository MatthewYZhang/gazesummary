Symbiosis is a close, long-lasting physical relationship between two different species, in which at least one derives benefit from the contact, and includes parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism. Parasitism involves one organism, the parasite, living on or in a host and deriving nourishment, generally harming the host. Newly established parasite-host relationships tend to be more destructive, while longstanding interactions lead to mutual accommodation. Ectoparasites live on the surface of their hosts, like fleas and lice. Endoparasites live inside the bodies of their hosts, such as tapeworms. Mistletoe is a plant that is parasitic on trees, establishing itself through bird-transferred seeds and growing into the tree's water-conducting tissues for nutrients. Commensalism benefits one organism without affecting the other, potentially evolving from parasitism as parasites cause less harm. Orchids growing on trees and remoras attaching to sharks exemplify commensalism. Mutualism benefits both species involved, sometimes obligatorily. Acacia trees provide food for ants that, in return, protect the trees from herbivores. Plants such as legumes and acacia trees have bacteria that live in their roots in little nodules, where the bacteria provide the plants with nitrogen-containing molecules.
