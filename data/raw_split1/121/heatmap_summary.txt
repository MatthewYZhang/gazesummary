Paleontologists have long debated the cause of the dinosaurs' demise, with the prevailing theory linking it to climatic changes driven by the shifting positions of continents and seas, as a result of plate tectonics. During the Cretaceous period, characterized by a milder climate with constant temperature and shallow seas, large shallow seas covered extensive areas of the continents.

At the end of the Cretaceous period, the geological record indicates that these seaways retreated from the continents back into major ocean basins, which caused climates around the world to become dramatically more extreme. The extreme temperature changes may have caused the dinosaurs to become extinct. But, cold-blooded animals such as snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles survived this time.

Scientists believed that the thin layer of clay found between the Cretaceous and Cenozoic rock layers could provide insights into the duration of the extinctions. The layer contains the element iridium (Ir), which is rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites. A new hypothesis that a single large asteroid collided with Earth, causing a dust cloud that disrupted sunlight and global temperatures, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs and other organisms in less than fifty years.
