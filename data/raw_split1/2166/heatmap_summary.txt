Pest control is essential, with many pest species being native to North America. Nonindigenous pests, like brown rats and cockroaches, cannot be eradicated and require control measures to manage their populations. Chemical pest control is an ancient method, as seen with the Sumerians using sulfur. However, it has a dark side, causing unintended consequences by affecting non-target species and upsetting food webs, particularly by suppressing native predators. This can lead to pests rebounding in even greater numbers and evolving resistance to pesticides.

Biological control involves introducing nonindigenous predators or parasites to control pests, such as the cactus-eating moth used in Australia. Although effective, this can backfire, as seen when the moth threatened native species in Florida. Using nonindigenous predators carries inherent risks that must be assessed. Therefore, chemical, biological, and other methods used individually are not the solution to pest control, entomologists have developed integrated pest management (IPM). 

IPM is a holistic approach that considers biological, ecological, economic, social, and even aesthetic aspects of pest control and employs a variety of techniques. IPM's objective is to control pests early by relying on natural mortality and using other methods only when necessary. Successful IPM requires knowledge of the population ecology of each pest and its associated species, and field work monitoring is essential to determine control needs.
