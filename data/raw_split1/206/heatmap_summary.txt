Biological functions in animals must be coordinated with periodic events such as the solar day and seasons. The relations between animal activity and these periods, particularly for daily rhythms, are very important. Environmental rhythms need to be coordinated with an animal's activity. The key question is whether an animal's schedule is driven by external cues or is dependent on internal timers. Biologists believe that all eukaryotes have internal clocks. By isolating organisms completely from external periodic cues, biologists learned that organisms have internal clocks. Normal daily periods of biological activity were maintained for a week by the fungus Neurospora when isolated from geophysical timing cues while orbiting in a space shuttle. Internal rhythms are kept in step by regular environmental cycles. For instance, if a homing pigeon is to navigate with its Sun compass, its clock must be properly set by cues provided by the daylight/darkness cycle.

Horseshoe crabs kept in the dark continuously for a year were found to maintain a persistent rhythm of brain activity. Such a rhythm whose period is approximately a day is called circadian. External cues such as sunrise maintain a cycle whose period is precisely 24 hours. A fifteen-minute burst of light can reset an animal's circadian rhythm.
