Deer populations in the Puget Sound area consist of two main species: the black-tailed deer, common in the lowlands of western Washington, and the Columbian white-tailed deer, now restricted to the Columbia River's islands and flood plains. Deer diets consist of a wide range of forest understory plants. Black-tailed deer browse on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and other shrubs or herbs during fair weather, but migrate in harsher seasons when plants decay, moving from high-elevation areas in summer to lowland areas in late fall, to access understory and arboreal fodder. Historical records show that deer numbers have fluctuated since European settlement. In the early 1800s, explorers and settlers noted abundant deer while simultaneously lamenting the scarcity of game. The numbers of deer declined but eventually recovered due to reduced predator populations, hunting restrictions, and the creation of feeding grounds through deforestation. The deforested areas result in open lands with higher protein content.
