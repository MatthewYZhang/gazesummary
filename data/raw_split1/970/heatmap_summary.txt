Transgenic plants are created by inserting genes from various organisms into plants, now used in agriculture on approximately 109 million acres globally. Common transgenic crops include soybeans, corn, cotton, and canola, often containing genes that confer resistance to glyphosate or produce Bt toxin, an insect-resistant protein.

Proponents argue transgenic crops are environmentally friendly because they reduce the need for harmful chemicals in crop production. For example, Bt cotton has led to a 21 percent reduction in insecticide use. However, questions remain about the effects of Bt plants on nontarget organisms, like monarch caterpillars consuming corn pollen near Bt cornfields, though field tests suggest minimal harm to monarchs. Also, opponents discuss whether herbicide-resistant genes will move into weedy populations through hybridization, potentially rendering glyphosate ineffective, particularly concerning is the evolution of insect populations resistant to Bt toxin with continuous toxin expression in transgenic Bt plants, potentially leading to resistant offspring. Farmers are using refuges to prevent insect resistance. There are also concerns that transgenic crops may encourage farmers to move away from sustainable agricultural practices by simplifying farming, but farmers should follow through with integrated pest-management practices.
