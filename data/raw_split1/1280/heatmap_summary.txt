Until the early- to mid-twentieth century, scientists believed that stars generate energy by shrinking, getting hotter, and giving off light. However, this meant stars would only last a million years, not billions as we know. Stars are fueled by nuclear fusion where energy is released as starlight. Two hydrogen nuclei smash together to form a deuteron, which combines with protons to form helium. Helium fuses to form heavier elements like carbon, building up significant quantities of heavy elements. There are two stellar types: Population I and Population II, the latter being much older. Population II stars date to the early universe and consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. They eventually die, spreading material into space, which can then incorporate into new Population I stars. As for the Sun, in several billion years, it will burn brighter, expend its fuel, and nuclear reactions will cease. It will separate into inner and outer zones. The inner zone will collapse, becoming dense and dim. The outer region will expand, and the Sun will become a red giant star. Finally, it will become a white dwarf star and die.
