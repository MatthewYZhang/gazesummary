The Moon's origin remains largely unknown. Previously, the popular hypothesis suggested the Moon formed similarly to Earth and other planets from a disk-shaped structure composed of rock fragments and gases orbiting the early Sun. However, a newer hypothesis proposes that a giant body collided with Earth, ejecting mantle rock that eventually formed the Moon. Some material remained in orbit, while the remainder either escaped or impacted Earth. Though the giant impact hypothesis provides a plausible mechanism, many questions remain. Planetary geologists have uncovered details of the Moon's history, including variations in crater density. The higher the crater density, the longer the feature has existed. During its early history, the Moon was continually impacted by debris, generating heat that melted its outer shell.

The last period of heavy bombardment recorded in the lunar highlands occurred almost 500 million years after the crust had formed. The next major event was the formation of maria basins, which filled with lava. Meteoroids created these pits, ejecting lunar rock. Radiometric dating places the maria basalts between 3.2 and 3.8 billion years old. The last prominent features were the rayed craters, exemplified by the crater Copernicus. Even relatively young craters must be millions of years old.
