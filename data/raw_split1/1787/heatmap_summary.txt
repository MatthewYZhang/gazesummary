Analysis of birds and of reptilian fossils indicates that birds belong to the group called therapods, with several species of dinosaurs closely related to birds having feathers with vanes and a wider range having filamentous feathers. The functions of these early feathers were insulation, camouflage, and courtship display. Many of the characteristics of birds are adaptations that facilitate flight, including weight-saving modifications and lack of a urinary bladder. Females of most species have only one ovary. Living birds are also toothless, an adaptation that trims the weight of the head. A bird's obvious adaptations for flight are its wings and feathers made of B-keratin, which is also found in the scales of other reptiles. The shape and arrangement of the feathers form the wings into airfoils. Flight provides ready escape from predators. One scenario of how flight evolved includes feathers enabling small, running dinosaurs chasing prey or escaping predators to gain extra lift as they jumped up into the air. By 150 million years ago, feathered therapods had evolved into birds, with Archaeopteryx remaining the earliest known bird. It had feathered wings but retained ancestral characteristics such as teeth and clawed digits in its wings.
