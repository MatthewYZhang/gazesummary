Tides, natural phenomena involving the alternating rise and fall of water, are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun. The tide-generating forces of the moon and sun lead to water accumulation at two opposite positions on earth, with compensating amounts drawn from points 90 degrees away. As Earth rotates, this produces a sequence of two high and two low tides each day, with successive high tides roughly 12.4 hours apart. The highest and lowest high tide levels, known as spring and neap tides, occur twice monthly. Spring tides happen when the moon, Earth, and sun align, reinforcing the moon's pull. Neap tides, the lowest high tide levels, occur when the sun-to-Earth direction is at right angles to the moon-to-Earth direction, minimizing the moon's pull. Also, several factors affect tidal ranges, including abrupt changes in atmospheric pressure or prolonged periods of extreme high or low pressure.
