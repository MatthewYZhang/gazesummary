In the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Europe experienced continued growth driven by increased agricultural productivity and expanding trade. A key factor was the rise of woolens and textile manufacturing, especially in rural areas where rural cottage production utilized cheap labor. This expansion of trade was aided by the development of banking and financial services, especially the widespread adoption of bills of exchange, which facilitated trade by eliminating the need to carry gold and silver. These bills of exchange, originating in medieval Italy, acted as promissory notes and provided credit. The rapid expansion of international trade was further fueled by capital infusions from Spanish vessels returning from the Americas, which financed goods, storage, and credit. Also, an increased credit supply was generated by investments and loans by bankers and wealthy merchants to states and by joint-stock partnerships, an English innovation.
