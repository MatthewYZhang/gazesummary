The Asian migration hypothesis is supported by scientific evidence. Data appeared in the 1980s, with the finding that Indians and northeast Asians share a common and distinctive pattern in teeth arrangement. Genetic research also demonstrates the close genetic relationship between these populations. A virus strain found in Navajos and Japanese is nearly identical, contrasting with European and African strains.

The migration could have begun over a land bridge during the last Ice Age, when glaciers lowered sea levels, creating Beringia, an ice-free grassland. This environment attracted Stone Age hunter-gatherers who followed large animal populations. They moved east, accompanied by dogs. Evidence also suggests the migration began around 30,000 years ago, based on blood type distribution.

Later, Athapascan people settled in North America around 5000 B.C.E. and migrated to the Southwest. The final migration began around 3000 B.C.E. with maritime hunters and later the Inuits and Yupiks.
