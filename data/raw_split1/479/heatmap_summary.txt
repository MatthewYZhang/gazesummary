Moving water was one of the earliest energy sources harnessed, dating back to irrigation systems 5,000 years ago, with the noria being a possible early waterpower device. Early waterpower mills were vertical-axis mills for grinding corn, appearing in the Middle East around the first or second century B.C. and later in Scandinavia. Sophisticated mills were built throughout the Roman Empire, and the Saxons in England used both horizontal and vertical-axis wheels.

Waterpower found applications in mining, iron working, paper making, and the wool and cotton industries, with England alone having about 20,000 mills by the end of the seventeenth century. The period from 1650 to 1800 saw scientific investigations of waterwheel designs, showing that water should pass smoothly across the blades for maximum efficiency. It was confirmed that an overshot wheel would win the efficiency competition. However, steam power emerged, casting doubt on the future of waterpower, though the electric industry later incorporated water power.

In 1832, a French engineer, Benoit Fourneyron, patented a new and more efficient waterwheel, marking a change in the technology. Half a century later, Faradayâ€™s discoveries led to full-scale power stations. In 1881, the Godalming power station in Surrey, England, used a waterwheel, but its unreliable water flow led to its replacement by a steam engine. The electric industry expanded rapidly, with power stations growing from a few kilowatts to over a megawatt in less than a decade.
