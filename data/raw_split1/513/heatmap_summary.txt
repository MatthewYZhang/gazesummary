Savannas, located in tropical areas at low altitudes, are stable ecosystems, consisting of vast grasslands with scattered trees and shrubs. The absence of a single determining factor allows their occurrence in a variety of soil types and climate extremes. Savannas experience a prolonged dry season, and a theory posits that wet forest species are unable to endure this dryness, favoring savanna development. Annual rainfall ranges from 1,000 to 2,000 millimeters, concentrated in a five- to eight-month wet season, with drought stress favoring grasses for the rest of the year. Savanna soils are similar to those of some rain forests, though more extreme. Like many rain forest soils, savanna soils are typically oxisols and ultisols, with a high acidity and notably low concentrations of minerals and high levels of aluminum. Most savannas probably experience mild fires frequently and major burns every two years or so. Many savanna and dry-forest plant species are called pyrophytes, meaning they are adapted in various ways to withstand occasional burning. On certain sites, particularly in South America, savanna formation seems related to frequent cutting and burning of moist forests for pastureland.
