The expression of emotions may be universal, as joy and sadness are experienced across cultures. Smiling is a sign of friendliness, and baring teeth signifies anger. Darwin proposed that recognizing facial expressions has survival value by signaling the approach of enemies. Certain facial expressions seem to suggest the same emotions in all people, and diverse cultures recognize these emotions. Paul Ekman's research with photographs of people exhibiting emotions showed that groups, even those with little Western contact, agreed on the emotions portrayed. Researchers recognize that facial expressions reflect emotional states and that the facial-feedback hypothesis argues that expressions can influence emotional state. Darwin's words suggest that expressing emotions intensifies them, while repressing them softens them. Smiling can give rise to positive feelings, and frowning to anger. Psychological research suggests that causing participants to smile or frown influences their reported feelings and perceptions. Arousal is linked to facial expressions and emotion, where muscle contraction heightens arousal. The Duchenne smile, characterized by specific facial features, can lead to pleasant feelings. A "stiff upper lip" may suppress emotional response unless the emotion is intense, in which case facial feedback may heighten it.
