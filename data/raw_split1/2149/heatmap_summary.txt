During the peak of the last ice age, northeast Asia and Alaska were connected by the Bering Land Bridge. Between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, Siberia, the Bering Land Bridge, and Alaska shared environmental characteristics, including a common mammalian fauna of large mammals and a common flora composed of broad grasslands, wind-swept dunes and tundra, and a common climate with cold, dry winters and somewhat warmer summers. Small groups of large mammal hunters used Beringia to colonize North and South America. Archaeologists generally agree that Beringia was critical to understanding human history, but disagree on what Beringia was like. 

The Beringian landscape supported herds of now-extinct species of mammoth, bison, and horse, as well as modern versions of caribou, mush ox, elk, and saiga antelope, which in turn supported carnivores. Arctic biologist Dale Guthrie argued that there must have been broad areas of dense vegetation to support the herds, since the ice-age fauna had teeth indicating an adaptation to grasses and sedges, and he demonstrated that the landscape must have been subject to intense and continuous winds. In contrast, Paul Colinvaux argued that the Beringian landscape during the peak of the last glaciation was more likely a "polar desert" with little or sparse vegetation, and that this region could not have supported large herds of mammals. Recent studies have revealed a preserved patch of Beringian vegetation dating to the peak of the last ice age, with grasses, sedges, mosses, and other varieties in a nearly continuous cover, but the vegetation had a thin root mat with no soil formation.
