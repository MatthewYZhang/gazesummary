Smell is the most direct and oldest sense, hard-wired into the brain. The olfactory nerve, managing smell perception, links receptors in the nose to the brain's memory, emotion, and behavior areas. The olfactory system detects airborne chemicals, transmitting information to the limbic system. Olfactory receptor cells, with cilia, absorb odor molecules. Inhaling a scent leads to odor molecules being absorbed by millions of olfactory receptor cells. These cells alert the olfactory nerve, sending impulses to the brain’s olfactory bulb. Scent may be the strongest trigger of memory and emotions. When we inhale a scent, receptors in the brain’s limbic center compare the odor entering our nose to odors stored in our memory. memories associated with those odors are stimulated. Smells can increase alertness and stimulate learning and retention. The scent of lavender could wake the metabolism and make people more alert. The smell of spiced apples could reduce blood pressure.
