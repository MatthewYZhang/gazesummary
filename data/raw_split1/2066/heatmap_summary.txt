The ecosystems of Oceania display both similarities and diversity, with island origins playing a key role. Islands like New Zealand, once part of continents, retain remnants of their earlier biota. Other islands, formed through geological processes, were initially devoid of terrestrial life. Winds, ocean currents, and birds introduced plants and animals, with the success of species dependent on their dispersal capabilities. The distribution of plants is estimated to be largely by birds. Oceanic biota generally migrated from west to east, influenced by island size and fertility, with larger islands supporting greater species diversity. Species diversity decreases further east, and latitude also affects the biotic mix.  Local adaptations led to unique species and the lack of indigenous mammals except for flying animals, and flightless birds in the Pacific islands. These islands were also influenced by the absence of mammals and other predators. Small, endemic species in limited ranges are vulnerable to disruption. Hawaii showcases this with its numerous species and subspecies of honeycreepers, fruit flies, and tree snails.
