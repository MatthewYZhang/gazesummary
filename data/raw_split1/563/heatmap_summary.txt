By the eighteenth century, Britain faced a severe energy shortage due to population growth and depletion of forests, crucial as a heat source and raw material for industries. The iron industry, vital for producing pig iron in blast furnaces using charcoal, struggled. Russia became a leading iron producer, exporting to Britain, but it faced limitations.

As the energy crisis worsened, Britain sought coal as an alternative, initially for heat. Later, coal mines deepened, requiring pumps powered by horses, which proved costly. Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen invented primitive steam engines to overcome these disadvantages, but these engines were inefficient. James Watt improved the Newcomen engine by adding a condenser. The steam engine was quickly adopted by several industries in Britain. In the 1780s, steam power replaced waterpower, significantly boosting industrialization. The steam-driven bellows in blast furnaces allowed iron makers to switch from charcoal to coke in smelting pig iron. The economic consequences resulted in a boom in the British iron industry.
