Social class is generally measured by income, occupation, and education. Sociologists use a layered model to describe the class system in the United States as upper, upper middle, middle, lower middle, and lower class. The upper class owns a major share of corporate and personal wealth and exercises enormous control throughout society. The best predictor of future wealth is the family into which you are born. The upper-middle class includes those with high incomes and high social prestige and are often well-educated professionals or business executives. It is difficult to estimate exactly how many people fall into this group because of the difficulty of drawing lines between the upper, upper middle, and middle classes. A large portion of Americans identify themselves as middle class even though they vary widely in lifestyle and resources. The lower middle class includes workers in the skilled trades and low-income bureaucratic workers, many of whom may actually define themselves as middle class. The lower class is composed primarily of the displaced and poor and has little formal education.
