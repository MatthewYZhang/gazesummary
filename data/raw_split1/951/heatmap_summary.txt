Living organisms, especially plants and animals, are essential in soil formation by releasing minerals, providing organic matter, aiding soil aeration and translocation, and protecting against erosion. Vegetation influences soil characteristics, allowing scientists to infer soil attributes from the flora present. Prairies and tundra, with distinct vegetations, also have distinct soils.

The quantity of flora exceeds that of fauna. Bacteria, the smallest and most numerous, transform rock into soil, producing organic acids to break down parent material. They decompose organic matter, forming humus. Legumes host bacteria that convert nitrogen gas into usable compounds, enriching the soil. Fungi decompose organic matter in acidic soils. Trees and plants provide humus and their decomposition enriches the soil with nutrients brought up from deep underground. Moreover, trees slow water runoff, preventing erosion, a problem exacerbated by vegetation removal in agriculture.

Animals, including protozoa and earthworms, also impact soil composition. Earthworms chemically alter ingested soil, producing nutrient-rich casts and enhancing aeration and drainage through vertical and horizontal soil mixing. Insects and mammals like ants, termites, moles, field mice, gophers, and prairie dogs mechanically aerate, fertilize, and bring soil to the surface, accelerating soil development.
