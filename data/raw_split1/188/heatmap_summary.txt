Determining which hand prehistoric people predominantly used can be inferred from several lines of evidence. Rock art, particularly stencils and prints in rock shelters and caves across Australia, France, Spain, and Tasmania, offers insights, where a stenciled left hand indicates a right-handed artist and vice versa, assuming the dominant hand aided in the paint spraying operation. In the French cave of Gargas, the majority of stencils, 136 out of 158, are identified as left hands, suggesting a prevalence of right-handedness. Other evidence for handedness can be found in cave art, such as engravings, which are lit to be viewed from the left, which shows that a right-handed artist created them.

Furthermore, analyzing tools, such as yew wood spoons and Ice Age ropes, can be indicative. For example, the rubbing on the left side of Neolithic spoons shows that right-handed people used them. The Ice Age rope found in the French cave of Lascaux consists of fibers spiraling to the right, and was therefore tressed by a right-hander.
