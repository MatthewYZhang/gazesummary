Trade formed the foundation of the urban economy in the Middle East. Caravan routes, shaped by water access and mountain ranges, have existed since ancient times. The region's geology, mainly limestone and sandstone, limited resources. Obsidian trade from Armenia and jade for cutting tools from Turkistan flourished, along with lapis lazuli imports from Afghanistan. These expeditions trace back to ancient Sumeria, the earliest Middle Eastern civilization. Sumerians established merchant caravans and trading posts in Persia and Arabia, exchanging grain for raw materials like timber, stones, metals, and gems. Guilds played a significant role, promoting egalitarianism and mutual support. International trade allowed guilds to govern themselves with little government interference, fostering harmony and ideological equality among individuals. The shift in trade routes by European seafarers in the late fifteenth century undermined the Middle Eastern empires and led to state fragility.
