Children's trusting nature towards media advertisements has led to advertisers being accused of exploitation. Regulators like the Independent Television Commission have criticized advertisers for misleading tactics, especially concerning techniques that obscure a toy's true nature. A key concern revolves around advertisers employing exaggeration. Consumer groups and parents argue that children lack the ability to recognize these techniques, often sacrificing accurate product information. Claims like "the best" are subjective and misleading. Advertisers use disclaimers, but children struggle to understand them, potentially misinterpreting the connection between a product like cereal and a balanced breakfast. Stephen Kline's analysis of Canadian television highlighted the prevalence of fantasy play in commercials for character toys. While fantasy captivates children, there is concern that young children may not always differentiate between fantasy and reality. The positive attributes of celebrities in advertisements can get transferred to the advertised product. Children accept characters that promote cereals as credible nutritional sources, and feel validated when a celebrity endorses a product.
