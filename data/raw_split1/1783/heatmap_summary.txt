Weather and climate, while related, differ significantly. Weather is the ever-changing combination of winds, clouds, temperature, and pressure, while climate represents the long-term average of weather. Despite scientists' understanding of physical laws governing atmospheric behavior, predicting weather is challenging. To predict the weather, two essential elements are required: the current weather conditions and how weather changes from one moment to the next. 

This can be simulated through a model world, specifying parameters like temperature, pressure, cloud cover, and wind. Inputting these initial conditions into a computer with equations describing weather changes can yield predictions, however, a slight change in initial conditions can cause vastly different predictions. The disagreement between predictions is due to the laws governing weather amplifying small changes over time, known as the butterfly effect.

The butterfly effect is a characteristic of chaotic systems described by nonlinear equations, where cause and effect are not proportional. For example, a change in wind speed in one location doesn't guarantee a similar change elsewhere. Despite their chaotic nature, these systems aren't entirely random and they have underlying order.
