During the last ice age, a land bridge called Beringia connected northeast Asia (Siberia) and Alaska because of lower sea levels. This region shared similar environmental characteristics, including a common mammalian fauna of large mammals and a flora of broad grasslands, wind-swept dunes, and tundra. Beringia played a crucial role in the colonization of North and South America by small groups of large mammal hunters. Dale Guthrie proposed that there were broad areas of dense vegetation to support herds of mammoth, horse, and bison due to the presence of mammal species that require grassland vegetation. He argued the landscape experienced intense and continuous winds to remove winter snows, exposing dry grasses. Recent discoveries include a 1,000-square-kilometer preserved patch of Beringian vegetation dating back 17,000 years with grasses, sedges, and mosses. However, this vegetation had a thin root mat without soil formation, supporting some arguments of Colinvaux, suggesting that there was little long-term stability in plant cover.
