Anthropology aims to understand humanity's origins, development, and the reasons behind diverse societal behaviors. Emerging as a science in the late eighteenth century, it is divided into physical and cultural branches, each with distinct focuses and methodologies. Physical anthropology delves into human evolution and variation, employing physiology, genetics, and ecology. Physical anthropologists analyze fossils and remains to understand how humans evolved, investigate blood chemistry, and study primate behavior to understand human habits. The Leakeys contributed significantly to this field, demonstrating that human evolution was centered in East Africa and unearthing tools and hominid fossils dating back 3.75 million years. Cultural anthropology explores past and present human life by studying similarities and differences among human communities through fieldwork and ethnographies. Some cultural anthropologists study patterns in marriage, beliefs, and practices. Margaret Mead was a famed cultural anthropologist who studied child rearing and gender, among other topics.
