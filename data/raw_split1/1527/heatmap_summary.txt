In North America, forests once covered a significant portion of the land, with nearly 90 percent of the eastern half of the continent being dense forests of various tree species. However, intensive deforestation resulted in the reduction of original forests to only half their former extent. During the first half of the nineteenth century, agriculture expanded and settlers moved westward, leading to the clearing of forests for farmland. By 1850, over 100 million acres of old-growth forest in the Northeast and other regions had been cut or burned. Industrialization, fueled by wood, further contributed to deforestation as charcoal was used in iron production. The Industrial Revolution relied on charcoal and hardwood, contributing significantly to deforestation. River steamboats also consumed vast amounts of wood, leading to the stripping of forests in river valleys. Railroads were built directly into the forests so that felled logs could be shipped directly to market. The timber industry continued to supply raw material for a growing population.
