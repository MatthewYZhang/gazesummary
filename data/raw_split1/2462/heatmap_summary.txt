Corals belong to cnidarians, a diverse group including hard and soft corals, sea fans, gorgonians, hydroids, jellyfish, and sea anemones. Cnidarians share features like a free-swimming larval stage, a central mouth, tentacles, and nematocysts used to catch prey. Individual corals are known as coral polyps. Unlike sea anemones, corals form colonies, budding from an initial polyp and growing to millions. Freed from living alone, colonies can grow to immense sizes.

Coral polyps secrete limestone or calcium carbonate to form skeletons. Hard corals build limestone skeletons under their living tissue, while soft corals secrete sclerites in a jellylike matrix. Some sea whips, fans, and black corals have dense, durable skeletons of limestone, protein, and minerals. These skeletons of black corals are collected for jewelry, especially the older, deeper colonies. Corals lift off the skeleton to feed with tentacles at night, and calcium carbonate fills ridges.
