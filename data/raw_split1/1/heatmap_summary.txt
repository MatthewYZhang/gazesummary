Groundwater saturates the ground, filling available spaces and circulating as part of the water cycle, originating from precipitation and lakes. The space necessary to hold this water exists in many forms, primarily among particles like sand grains in unconsolidated sand and gravel. These materials are found where fast rivers once flowed, carrying sediment. A smaller scale version happens in sediment-laden rivers emerging onto flat land, and when rivers slow on entering a lake or sea, depositing sediment on lake and sea floors, forming beds that can be thousands of meters thick. These sediments also contain water-holding pores because gaps among original grains aren't plugged by cementing chemicals and parts of original grains may be dissolved, resulting in porous rocks like sandstone. 

Empty space constitutes a proportion of any sediment, loose or cemented. The proportion of empty space in a rock is known as its porosity, which is not the same as permeability. In a sample of water-saturated sediment, water clings to solid surfaces by surface tension without which the sediment would be totally dry.
