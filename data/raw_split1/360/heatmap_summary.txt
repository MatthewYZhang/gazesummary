On February 8, 1969, a large meteor entered Earth's atmosphere and broke into thousands of pieces, scattering over an area in Chihuahua, Mexico. The fragments were named Allende, after the village of Pueblito de Allende. Individual Allende specimens have a black, glassy crust formed from their exteriors melting in Earth's atmosphere. When broken open, they reveal small, distinctive objects embedded in a dark gray matrix. These objects were once constituents of the solar nebula, the cloud of gas and dust that formed our solar system. 

The Allende meteorite is a chondrite, named for its appearance as containing tiny seeds. These seeds are actually millimeter-sized melted droplets of silicate material that were cooled into spheres of glass and crystal. These enigmatic chondrules formed when masses of nebular dust were fused at high temperatures and cooled. The origin of these spheres remains an enigma. These diverse constituents are aggregated together to form chondritic meteorites that have chemical compositions much like that of the Sun.
