The Industrial Revolution's roots can be traced back to the commercial revolution, which began in the sixteenth century alongside Europe's overseas expansion. The growth of both exports and imports, particularly in England and France, was remarkable. Trade with overseas colonies accounted for an increasing portion of this expanded commercial activity. This trade brought a range of new beverages, spices, and food items into Europe, while European textiles, hardware, firearms, ships, and related goods were exported around the world, resulting in a return flow of money.

Great Britain's numerous economic advantages fostered an environment favorable to technological advancement. One factor was its advantageous geographic location at the intersection of international trade routes. Britain was blessed with easily navigable natural waterways internally, which improved its trade and communication with the rest of the globe. The country experienced a canal-building boom starting in the 1770s, making its domestic market more easily accessible. Furthermore, Great Britain had vast coal and iron ore deposits that fueled factories and supplied the raw materials needed to make railway equipment, tools, and other industrial and consumer products.
