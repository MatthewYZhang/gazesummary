Cave art in Europe includes beads, carvings, and paintings dating back to the Upper Paleolithic period. The cave paintings in Spain and southern France showcase significant skill, as do naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa, which appear to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago. Paintings in Africa may be as old as paintings in Europe. The early Australians may have painted on rock shelters and cliff faces as much as 60,000 years ago.

Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe, including rock shelters and cave entrances, galleries off inhabited areas, and the inner reaches of caves, which may indicate magical-religious activities. The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals, painted on bare walls. Upper Paleolithic people may have believed that drawing a human image could cause death, explaining the rarity of human figures in cave art. 

Patricia Rice and Ann Paterson suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly those preferred for meat and materials such as hides. Wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often, as well as animals that the painters may have feared, such as mammoths. Upper Paleolithic art also included decorated spear shafts and figurines representing the human female.
