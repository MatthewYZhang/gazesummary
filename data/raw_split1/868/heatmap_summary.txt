Icebergs are massive blocks of ice formed by glaciers that move toward the sea. These glaciers originate inland in areas such as Greenland, Antarctica, and Alaska. The forward movement, melting at the base, and wave action cause ice blocks to break off. Icebergs are generally blue to white but can appear dark due to gravel. Light conditions and cloud cover can change their color, with pink or gold hues in the morning or evening. Travelers have reported seeing green icebergs in the Weddell Sea, near the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica. One explanation attributes their color to an optical illusion when blue ice is illuminated by a near-horizon red Sun. Recent expeditions have taken ice samples from green icebergs and ice cores, leading to a solution of the problem. The scientists found that the clear sea ice was very similar to the ice from the green iceberg. Green icebergs form when a two-layer block of shelf ice breaks away and capsizes, exposing bubble-free shelf ice from seawater. When an iceberg separates from the ice shelf and capsizes, the green ice is exposed.
