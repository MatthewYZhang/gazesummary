Pterosaurs were the second group of animals to evolve flight. The size of pterosaurs ranged from that of sparrows to the largest flying animals. In 1817, Theodore Von Soemmerring published the first description of a pterosaur fossil, mistaking it for a bat. His reconstruction depicted a batlike posture and wing, influencing perceptions of pterosaurs for years to come. The reconstruction displayed laterally directed legs, reoriented feet of bats, and the wing membrane stretching from the arm and finger along the sides of the body and legs all the way to the ankle. The reconstruction also included a membrane stretching between the legs, similar to that in bats. Scientists developed less batlike descriptions, but the popular literature continued to describe pterosaurs as batlike into the 1980s. Pterosaurs had large sternums, well-developed shoulder bones, and air-filled bones. Some even had a furcula to flex like a spring during the upstroke. Biologists now agree that pterosaurs were capable of powered, flapping flight. The shoulder joint is clearly specialized for the down-and-forward, up-and-back movement of normal flapping. Early pterosaurs could have used their forelimbs for walking. Most species probably walked on all fours.
