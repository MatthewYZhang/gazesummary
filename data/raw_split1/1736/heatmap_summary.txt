Archeology, the systematic study of material remains such as architecture, inscriptions, sculpture, vase painting, and other forms of decorative art, is one of the primary ways of approaching the Greek theatre. Serious on-site excavations began in Greece around 1870, but W. DÃ¶rpfeld did not begin the first extensive study of the Theatre of Dionysus until 1886. Since that time, more than 167 other Greek theatres have been identified and many of them have been excavated. Archeology provides the most concrete evidence we have about the theatre structures of ancient Greece.

Vase paintings are a controversial use of archeological evidence in theatre history, depicting scenes from mythology and daily life. Some scholars have considered any vase that depicts a subject treated in a surviving drama or any scene showing masks, flute players, or ceremonials to be valid evidence of theatrical practice, which is a questionable assumption.

The texts to classical Greek plays were written down soon after the performance, and Hellenistic scholars dedicated years to sorting out the text, but each time a text was copied, there were new possibilities for errors. The oldest surviving manuscripts of Greek plays date from around the tenth century C.E. The scripts offer us our readiest access to the cultural and theatrical conditions out of which they came. The existing plays feature numerous choruses of women and many feature strong female characters, and critics have differing views on how to interpret them. The broad outlines of Greek theatre history are reasonably clear, but many of the details remain open to doubt.
