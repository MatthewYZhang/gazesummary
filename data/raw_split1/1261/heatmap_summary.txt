There are eight chipmunk species in the Sierra Nevada, each tending to occupy a specific habitat type within an elevational range. The eight species represent a fraction of the fifteen found in western North America, in contrast to the eastern part of the continent, which has only one. The West's unique ecology, with its mountains and deserts, promotes the geographic isolation of chipmunk populations and species formation. Ecologists have studied the four chipmunk species on the eastern slope of the Sierra and how they interact while maintaining distinct elevational zones. The sagebrush chipmunk occupies the lowest elevation among sagebrush, while the yellow pine chipmunk thrives in low to mid-elevations and open conifer forests. The lodgepole chipmunk is found at higher elevations, and the alpine chipmunk ventures among the talus slopes, alpine meadows, and high-elevation pines and junipers. The answer to why chipmunk species do not move between zones is aggression; species actively defend their territories from encroachment. The yellow pine chipmunk bullies the sagebrush chipmunk, preventing it from entering pine forests, and the lodgepole chipmunk prevents the alpine chipmunks from moving downslope.
