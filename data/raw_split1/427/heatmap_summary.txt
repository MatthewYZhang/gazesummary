The harsh conditions in deserts are intolerable for most plants and animals. Water regulates temperature and controls volume of plant matter. Desert plants adapt to the prevailing aridity by developing as long-lived perennials, which are often succulent, or as annuals or ephemerals.

Ephemeral plants evade drought and produce many flowers and fruits. Perennial vegetation adjusts to aridity with avoidance mechanisms and are classified as xerophytes. Xerophytes reduce water loss through dense hairs, closing pores, and shedding leaves. Succulents store water. These plants also have limited mass above ground and have extensive root networks. Another desert plant, the phreatophyte, develops taproots to reach groundwater.

Animals adapt through escape or retreat. Escape includes aestivation, reducing metabolic rate and body temperature. Seasonal migration is common among large mammals or birds. Animals use retreat as a short-term escape. Some animals have morphological adaptations to withstand extreme conditions. Ostriches have plumage that protects them from solar radiation and allows air movement. Birds orient themselves to the sun and flap their wings for cooling.
