The leatherback turtle is unique among reptiles and can swim farther into cold oceans. Adult leatherbacks can maintain a body temperature between 25 and 26°C in seawater that is only 8°C. They generate heat in their body and prevent it from escaping into the water. Leatherbacks don't generate internal heat via metabolism the way that birds do. They may pick up heat by basking and absorbing solar radiation, but most of their internal heat comes from muscle action.

Leatherbacks keep their body heat in three ways: The first way is size, where the larger the animal, the lower its surface-to-volume ratio. The second way is having a thick, oil-saturated skin. The third way is a countercurrent exchange system, where cooled blood from the flippers runs close to blood vessels carrying warm blood from the body. This transfers heat from outgoing to ingoing vessels, preventing it from reaching the flipper. Hatchlings are too small to conserve body heat, and scientists are not sure when a leatherback switches from a cold-blooded to a warm-blooded mode of life.
