To understand the ecological difficulties faced by the ancient Mayan people, one must consider their environment, which is inaccurately viewed as a typical "jungle." The Maya homeland is in a "seasonal tropical forest," with a rainy season from May to October and a dry season from January to April. Rainfall in the Yucatan Peninsula varies unpredictably, impacting modern farmers and likely posing challenges for the ancient Maya as well. Although southern Maya areas received more rainfall, paradoxically, they faced more severe water problems due to the increasing surface elevation from north to south in the Yucatan Peninsula, which made it harder to reach the water table. The Maya responded by excavating depressions, modifying natural depressions, and plastering the bottoms to create reservoirs. For example, the reservoirs at the Maya city of Tikal held enough water to meet the drinking water needs of about 10,000 people for a period of 18 months. However, prolonged droughts would have put even those cities in trouble.
