Actors, even when well-rehearsed, can't fully anticipate performance quality before an audience. A brilliant rehearsal performance may crumble due to stage fright. Conversely, an unexciting rehearsal can dazzle with unexpected energy. Lee J. Cobb's role in Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman exemplifies this. Roles rehearsed solemnly can become comical; comic roles can be received soberly, losing their comedic aspect. Sudden, dramatic change isn't the norm, with most actors experiencing only slight shifts from dress rehearsal to opening night. Restraining emotional display until opening night is disavowed.

However, a fundamental shift occurs in the actor’s awareness between rehearsal and performance, with the actor being aware of the audience’s reaction and subtly adjusting. The best actors radiate a quality known as presence, making the character vibrant. Performance is a two-way communication where actors employ text and movement, and the audience uses applause, laughter, silence, and attention. Even when silent or invisible, the actor feels the audience's presence, where silence betokens attention. Laughter and applause feed into the actor’s consciousness, and actors can ride the crest of laughter and adjust their energy when sensing restlessness. Performance technique is more instinctual than learned.
