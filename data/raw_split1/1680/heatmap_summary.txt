Clothing and costume serve various functions, extending beyond mere physical protection. Ancient Greeks and Chinese believed that clothing was primarily for physical reasons, like protection from elements. However, ethnologists and psychologists suggest psychological reasons such as modesty or desire to please. Anthropological research points to the earliest use of clothing for carrying objects. Hunting-gathering ancestors, especially male hunters, benefited from simple belts or animal skins to carry weapons and tools. Female gatherers required more elaborate carrying devices, such as bags or slings, to transport collected food and babies. These functions also help maintain body warmth.

Later, costume developed to serve purposes beyond utility. Costume can impose authority or inspire fear. A chieftain's costume represents power, a warrior's superhuman strength, and in recent times, professional costumes express authority. Costume also communicates status and power, often associated with wealth, and uniforms serve to display membership in a group, like the military, where they communicate rank and protect the body. Even religious vestments signify spiritual authority.
