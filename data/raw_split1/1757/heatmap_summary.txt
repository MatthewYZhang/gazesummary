Between 4000 and 3000 B.C., technological developments began to transform the Neolithic towns. The invention of writing enabled records to be kept, and the use of metals marked a new level of human control over the environment and its resources. Before 4000 B.C., craftspeople discovered that metal-bearing rocks could be heated to liquefy metals, which could then be cast in molds to produce tools and weapons. Copper was the first metal utilized in producing tools, after 4000 B.C. craftspeople in western Asia discovered that a combination of copper and tin produced bronze, a harder and more durable metal than copper. The widespread use of bronze has led historians to call the period the Bronze Age; thereafter, from around 3000 to 1200 B.C., bronze was increasingly replaced by iron. Early human beings formed small groups that developed a simple culture that enabled them to survive. As human societies grew and developed greater complexity, a new form of human existence—called civilization—came into being. Historians have identified a number of basic characteristics of civilization including: an urban focus, a distinct religious structure, new political and military structures, a new social structure based on economic power, the development of writing, and new forms of significant artistic and intellectual activity. Some historians have argued that nonmaterial forces, primarily religious, provided the sense of unity and purpose that made such organized activities possible.
