Glaciers are slowly moving masses of ice that form where snowfall exceeds melting. Snow transforms into smaller, rounded grains, which compact and become denser as air space decreases. With further melting, refreezing, and increased weight, the snow reaches a granular, recrystallized stage known as firn. Over time, with pressure and refrozen meltwater, the firn granules grow into larger, interlocked crystals of blue glacial ice. When the ice becomes thick enough, usually over 30 meters, the weight causes the crystals to become plastic and flow outward from the area of accumulation. Glaciers are open systems that have snow input and meltwater output.

For a glacier to maintain its mass, there must be sufficient snowfall to match the annual loss through melting, evaporation, and calving. Glaciers are part of Earth’s hydrologic cycle and store a vast amount of freshwater. A large percentage of the world's freshwater is locked in glaciers. The melting of the world's glaciers would significantly raise sea levels, while another ice age would drastically lower them. Glaciers move slowly across the land, carving the landscape, depositing rock debris in new locations. Today, glaciers cover about 10% of Earth’s land surface and are found in Antarctica, Greenland, and at high elevations on all continents except Australia. In the past, a third of Earth was covered by ice.
