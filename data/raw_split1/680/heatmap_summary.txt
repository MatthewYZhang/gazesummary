The camera obscura, a precursor to the modern camera, functions as a darkened enclosure that admits light through a lens or small hole, projecting an inverted image onto a surface. This technique was known as early as the fifth century B.C. in China, and was later explored by Aristotle and Leonardo da Vinci, who described it in 1490. Giovanni Battista Della Porta suggested adding a convex lens to enhance the image quality for tracing. Portable camera obscuras were then developed with mirrors and drawing tables, which allowed artists to draw forms with precise linear perspective and to reverse projected images.  Vermeer, who lived from 1632 to 1675, may have used the camera obscura. David Hockney also investigated the secret use of the camera obscura, claiming that many of Western art’s great masters probably used the device. From an artist’s point of view, a camera obscura compresses the complicated forms of a three-dimensional scene into two-dimensional shapes that can easily be traced and also increases the contrast between light and dark. Hockney argues that the camera obscura does not replace artistic skill.
