East African herbivores, including buffalo, zebras, wildebeests, topi, and Thomson's gazelles, constitute a significant portion of the Serengeti's mammal population. Despite seemingly sharing the same diet of grasses, herbs, and bushes, Richard Bell's analysis revealed that each species consumes different parts of the vegetation, with zebras preferring stem matter, wildebeests favoring leaves, and topi occupying an intermediate position. Thomson's gazelles consume the sparsely distributed, highly nutritious fruits.

The diverse feeding preferences among these herbivores are linked to differences in their digestive systems and body sizes. Nonruminants, like zebras, possess digestive systems akin to horses, while ruminants, such as wildebeests, topi, and gazelles, resemble cows. Ruminants, with their rumen, can extract more energy from food. Zebras graze in areas with low-quality food and migrate to new areas, consuming the abundant low-quality stems. When the wildebeests and other ruminants arrive, they consume the lower, leafier parts of the vegetation. The differences in body size further contribute to the explanation.

The differences in feeding preferences lead to differences in migratory habits. Zebras are the first to exploit a new area fueled by rain, followed by wildebeests and then Thomson's gazelles.
