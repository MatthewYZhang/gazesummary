The invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century greatly altered perceptions of the visible world, impacting painting. Realistic and naturalistic painters were aware of photography. Photography had been awaited and utilized the camera obscura. Louis Daguerre perfected a method of fixing images on a silvered copper plate, resulting in the "daguerreotype," announced in 1839. William Henry Talbot patented the "calotype," a negative-to-positive process. The calotype used chemically treated paper to produce a negative image that could be used to print multiple positive images. The daguerreotype reproduced minute detail and was unique, while the calotype could be made in series and was equivalent to an etching. The introduction of lighter and simpler equipment, and of new emulsions that coated photographic plates, film, and paper and enabled images to be made at much faster speeds had some unanticipated consequences. Scientific experiments made by photographers demonstrated that the movements of both humans and animals differed widely from the way they had been traditionally represented in art. The new candid photography confirmed these scientific results.
