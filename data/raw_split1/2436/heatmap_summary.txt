Archaeologists differentiate between the "cultural" formation processes, involving human activity, and "natural" formation processes, like river action. Two kinds of cultural processes exist: those before a find or site is buried, reflecting original human behavior, and those after burial, such as looting. Most archaeological sites are a complex sequence of use, burial, and reuse, making a simple division difficult to apply, though still useful.

Original human behavior is reflected in four activities, such as raw material acquisition, manufacture, use, and discard, which can include reworking and recycling. A food crop undergoes harvesting, processing, consumption, and excretion, with a storage stage added. Remains can enter the archaeological record at any stage. The critical factor is that remains can enter the archaeological record at any one of these stages. Identifying the stage is crucial for accurate reconstruction.

Deliberate burial of valuables or the dead provides evidence. Hoards are sources for periods like the Bronze Age, yielding metal goods, or Roman Britain, with silver treasures. However, distinguishing reclaimed hoards from offerings is hard. In addition to hoards, burial of the dead in graves, mounds, or pyramids includes grave goods like ceramics or weapons. Some cultures mummified their dead, like the Egyptians and Incas. Human destruction may involve digging into earlier deposits, intentional obliteration, or preservation through burning.
