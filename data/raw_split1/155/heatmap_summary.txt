One major challenge in assessing the impact of human activities on the climate lies in determining natural climate variability. The climate has undergone significant changes naturally, and it is important to interpret the extent to which recent changes are natural versus human-caused. To better understand fluctuations further back in time, proxy records are needed.

Proxy data is derived from substances whose properties change with the climate, providing a continuous record of past conditions. These include information on temperature, rainfall, and other climate aspects, and proxy temperature records have been reconstructed from various sources like ice cores and sediment cores. Proxy records show that significant natural changes have occurred in the climate over timescales longer than a few thousand years. To understand the natural causes of climate change, fluctuations of the atmosphere, behavior of the oceans, changes in land surfaces, and variations from volcanic and solar activity must be considered.

Computer models can be used to estimate the processes leading to climate variability. The external influences, such as volcanoes and solar activity, have measurable impact on the climate.
