The Minoan palaces of Crete, constructed between 1950 and 1450 B.C., served as centers of power. The palaces were hubs of activity, including the receipt, recording, and storage of goods. Administration of the goods and commodities leaving the storerooms also took place throughout the year. Craft workers, including gold, ivory, and semiprecious stone specialists, produced works within the palaces, relying on the palaces for their needs. Bronze workers were also present, but pottery workshops were further, situated near the clay beds and fuel for the kilns rather than within palace confines. Many nonspecific rooms could have been lived in by various dependents--craft workers, guards, textile workers, servants, or slaves. The ingrained and embedded religious nature of the palaces has been accepted. The Minoan tradition indicates a king- yet power may have been wielded by a priest, or by a priest-king, combining functions that we would divide into sacred and secular.
