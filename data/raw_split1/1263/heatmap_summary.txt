In the early twentieth century, sociology gained traction in the United States and Canada due to rapid urbanization and concerns about the ability of cities to accommodate new arrivals. Presociological thinkers such as Frederick Law Olmsted and Jacob Riis advocated for investments in urban improvements, including parks, beaches, and better housing, to address these challenges. Sociologists supported these reform efforts through empirical research on urban social conditions. Many sociologists lived in rapidly growing cities like Chicago, facing significant social problems. This context prompted the use of empirical research to develop theories on how cities evolve in response to social forces and urban planning.
Park and Burgess developed a dynamic model of the city, accounting for expansion and patterns of settlement and land use. The model builds on the concept of "natural areas," like occupational suburbs and residential enclaves, characterized by homogeneous populations and unplanned land use. Urban expansion involves successive "invasions" of zones around the city center. For instance, immigrants often move to inexpensive housing areas close to work. Those who can afford it move farther from the business district, in turn,  invading areas that are farther from the business district. The concentric zone model is a theory that describes the zones of urban growth and can be used to analyze patterns in cities built around central business districts.
