Architecture is the art and science that designs structures to organize and enclose space. These structures fulfill practical and symbolic purposes, communicating cultural values and profoundly impacting our lives by shaping the environment. Architecture, being three-dimensional, utilizes elements like space, mass, texture, line, light, and color. A building, to be considered architecture, must harmonize these elements. Humans instinctively seek structures for shelter and improvement of life. Architects create buildings that are not only constructions but also sources of inspiration. Buildings contribute to human well-being by providing shelter, enhancing space, complementing the site, and being economically feasible. The client who defines the building's function is a crucial part of the architectural team.

Architecture employs methods of support based on physical laws, which have remained relatively unchanged despite dramatic changes in building materials. Architectural structures are designed to withstand forces like compression and tension, often in combination. Technological changes have led to the invention of new materials and construction techniques, enabling the enclosure of space with greater ease and a minimum of material. Modern architectural forms often comprise a supporting skeleton, an outer skin, and internal equipment. Much of the world's great architecture has been constructed of stone, including structures with doorways and windows made possible by placing thick stone beams to support weight. The arch, a curved structure made of separate segments, was developed, with the Romans pioneering its extensive use in aboveground structures. The arch supports greater weight than a horizontal beam by diverting weight to the sides, marking a significant structural breakthrough in architecture.
