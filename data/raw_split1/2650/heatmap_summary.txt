The Pearl River Delta in southern China was an agriculturally rich region due to its alluvial soils. By the sixteenth century, farmers produced two crops of rice, vegetables, and wheat, along with commercial crops like sugarcane, hemp, cotton, and mulberries. Commerce was important until 1550, but the economy wasn't commercialized until later. The agricultural economy of the region became highly commercialized after 1550 due to a new demand for Chinese goods, especially silk and porcelains, from European traders. Trade through Manila brought silver into the South China economy. The Spanish bought goods with silver, which then flowed back to China.

The silk industry developed in the Pearl River Delta with a combination of fish ponds and fruit trees. Farmers began replacing rice fields with fishponds in response to the demand from Guangzhou. They planted fruit trees on the embankments, creating a fruit tree and fishpond combination. The fruit tree and fishpond culture provided a base for expansion of the silk industry, and farmers replaced fruit trees with mulberry trees, digging up more rice paddies to expand the system.
