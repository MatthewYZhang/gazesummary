Group decision making comes with advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that groups bring together diverse experience and expertise to focus on problems. This combined knowledge base allows for a better understanding of situations and consideration of more alternatives, as individuals can contribute their unique insights. Moreover, participation in group decision making increases satisfaction and commitment, leading to easier implementation. 

However, group decision making has drawbacks. It can be time-consuming due to discussions and the need to compromise. A waste of time becomes a disadvantage if an individual alone could have made the decision faster. Furthermore, dominant individuals or subgroups can undermine group effectiveness by monopolizing discussions. Finally, a major disadvantage of group decision making is that members may be less concerned with the group's goals than with their own personal goals. Groupthink, an agreement-at-any-cost mentality, occurs when groups are insulated with directive leaders, leading to bad decisions due to the illusion of invulnerability and pressure on dissenters. Groupthink may also result when group members have preconceived ideas about how a problem should be solved.
