Until the late 1980s, life was thought to be limited to the top few meters of soil or ocean sediments, with reports of organisms from greater depths dismissed as contamination. Two technical advancements changed this view. Drilling techniques were developed to retrieve samples from depth without contamination. Samples were recovered using a diamond-studded drill bit and a concentrated tracer material was added to the lubricating fluid. Any contaminated material could be identified and removed. The second development was the use of techniques for identifying microorganisms without needing to grow them in culture by staining the DNA directly. The first scientists that used these techniques were involved in the DOE's Subsurface Science Program. They demonstrated the presence of microorganisms in rocks down to 500 meters.

Microbes have been found in various rocks and ocean sediments, with life discovered 3.5 kilometers below ground in a South African gold mine. The pressure and temperature increase with depth. Subsurface bacteria could withstand temperatures as high as 150â„ƒ, allowing organisms to exist 7 kilometers beneath the seafloor and 4 kilometers below the land surface. Bacteria are the most numerous of subsurface organisms, and 10,000 strains of microorganisms have been isolated from subsurface cores. These organisms rely on nutrients trapped within sedimentary rocks and some are chemotrophs. They derive energy from the oxidation of iron or sulfur compounds and build organic material directly from carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas dissolved in the rock.
