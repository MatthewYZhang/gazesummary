For most of human history, humans have foraged for food, with small nomadic groups easily supplying their necessities. The organization of such societies was simple, revolving around age and gender categories and generally egalitarian. Donald Henry suggests that the combination of a rich habitat and sedentism led to a dramatic increase in human population. Nomadic foragers have relatively low levels of fertility due to high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets resulting in low body-fat levels, and high levels of physical activity and long periods of nursing. A more settled existence in areas with abundant food resources contributed to higher fertility levels, and a diet higher in wild cereals produces proportionally more body fat, leading to higher fertility among women. Cereals would have supplemented and then replaced mother's milk as the primary food for older infants, and substituting cereals for mother's milk would have resulted in closer spacing of births and the potential for a greater number of live births for each woman. Another option is to stay in the same area but to shift and intensify the food quest there. Hierarchies that did not exist in earlier foraging groups but that were helpful in structuring cooperative labor and in organizing more-complex technologies probably became established.
