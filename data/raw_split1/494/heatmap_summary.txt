Play is easier to define with examples of activities like leaping, running, climbing, throwing, wrestling, and other movements. Depending on the species, play may be primarily for social interaction, exercise, or exploration. However, the intentions of animals during play are not always clear from behaviors alone. Play appears to be a developmental characteristic of animals with fairly sophisticated nervous systems. It has been studied most extensively in primates and canids (dogs). Determining the functions of play is difficult because the functions may be long-term, with beneficial effects not showing up until the animal's adulthood. The benefits of play must outweigh costs, or play would not have evolved, according to Darwin's theory. Learning appropriate social behaviors is especially important for species that live in groups, like young monkeys that needed to learn to control selfishness and aggression and to understand the give-and-take involved in social groups. There is a danger that play may be misinterpreted or not recognized as play by others, potentially leading to aggression. Thus, many species have evolved clear signals to delineate playfulness.
