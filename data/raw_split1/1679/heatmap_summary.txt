Musical talent often surfaces early, with children showing musical aptitude for various reasons, including well-structured instruction like the Suzuki method for the violin. A musically gifted child has an inborn talent, and the environment plays a crucial role in how the talent manifests publicly. Musical talent may also be connected to disabling conditions like autism. Children master elements of music such as pitch and rhythm early on. Pitch is central in some cultures, like Eastern societies using quarter-tone intervals, while rhythm is crucial in sub-Saharan Africa. Children sing as well as babble and can match sounds and patterns. Some children show musical talent early and can match song segments by age two or three, while most can produce reasonable imitations by school age. The early display of superior musical ability suggests it's a unique form of intelligence, needing about ten years to reach mastery. Throughout music history, there have been prodigies, such as Mozart, who started composing and performing at a young age and became a master. Unusual musical ability is also a characteristic of anomalies such as autism.
