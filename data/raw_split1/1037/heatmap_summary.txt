Exotic species, often introduced deliberately or accidentally, can pose threats to established communities. Unlike most imports, these species can insinuate themselves permanently into a new community, frequently causing harm to native species. 70 percent of species on endangered lists owe their demise to displacement by exotic species. The British settlers in Australia imported familiar animals. In 1859, an Australian landowner imported and released two dozen wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). These rabbits, lacking natural predators, multiplied rapidly. Australia now has 200 to 300 million rabbits, which transform grasslands and shrublands into eroded deserts. Efforts to control the population through various methods have been largely ineffective. In 1951, a myxoma virus was introduced to control rabbits, causing myxomatosis. However, rabbits have since developed resistance. In 1991, a calcivirus was released, killing rabbits, but it has since escaped. Kudzu, deliberately imported from Japan, faces no serious threats, so it blankets streambanks, trees, telephone poles, and houses in the United States.
