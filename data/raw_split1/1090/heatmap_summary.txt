The reinterpretation of the Paleolithic past emphasizes the role of women in the food-foraging economy. Researchers like Softer, Adovasio, and Hyland suggest that human survival depended on women, plants, and net hunting, a previously overlooked technique.  Soffer states "Net hunting is communal, and it involves the labor of children and women." European archeologists traditionally focused on stone tools and big-game bones. Most researchers believed women were primarily devoted to breast-feeding.

Looking at ethnography, women played a role in net hunting, a technique that didn't require strength or risk for mothers. Among Australian aborigines, women helped knot nets. Native American groups would help lay out their handiwork on poles. The entire camp acted as beaters, flushing game into the net. Soffer says "Everybody and their mother could participate...Once you got the net on these animals, they were immobilized." People seldom came home empty-handed.

Soffer says that camps from Germany to Russia are littered with bones. Additionally, Ice Age women played powerful roles.
