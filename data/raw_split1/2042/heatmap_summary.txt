The central question in the archaeology of the southwestern United States is why settlements were abandoned. Tim Kohler has suggested that human-environmental interaction was an important reason for the abandonment of the Anasazi people, specifically in the Dolores River basin of southwest Colorado, where the Anasazi seem to have moved in around A.D. 600. The population increased, and they aggregated into villages, but by about A.D. 900 the area began to be abandoned, potentially due to short growing seasons that put pressure on corn production.

Kohler uses evidence to show that human effects, not solely climatic factors, were important factors in the abandonment of settlements. He argues that pinon was disappearing from the locale of settlements and that this put an additional nutritional strain on the population, which used nuts from the tree as well as its wood. 

Kohler argues that, people had aggregated into villages by about A.D. 840, and that slash-and-burn agriculture encouraged a further dependence on agriculture and the aggregation of people into denser settlements. The Anasazi responded to increasing agricultural risks by further intensification, such as water-control mechanisms. A reliance on the management of resources through cooperative action reduced their flexibility of action, so that when poor seasons occurred, people were seriously hurt.
