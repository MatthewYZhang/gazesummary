The forked tongue of snakes has captivated people for a long time and has been the source of many theories. One of the early explanations was that the forked tongue acts as a tactile organ, allowing snakes to feel their surroundings in a similar way to a blind person using a cane.

In 1920, Browman proposed the forked tongue delivers chemical stimuli to the vomeronasal organs (VNO) and this hypothesis was widely accepted for a while. However, this hypothesis was disproved by X-ray studies. Schwenk has a theory that the forked tongue allows the snake to sense chemical stimuli simultaneously and detect differences in an odor trail, enhancing the ability to follow pheromone trails.

This spatial chemical perception is like other systems for spatial perception that are based on simultaneous stimulation of two separated sense organs. Several kinds of evidence support the hypothesis that forked tongues evolved as chemosensory edge detectors to enhance the ability to follow odor trails. For example, male gypsy moths have antennae with which they track potential mates, and the ant nest beetle has antennae extending from each side of the head with which it detects pheromones.
