Until the sixteenth century, most music was written for voices, with instrumental music largely substituting instruments for voices in vocal pieces. The seventeenth century saw the rise of music without extramusical meaning, where instrumental music carried no explicit narrative content, independent of religious expression or vocalized text, becoming an aesthetic exercise for its own sake. This was a notable feature of the era and distinguished Western European music from the traditions of Asia and Africa.

The rise of instrumental music was accompanied by the perfection of stringed instruments like the violin, viola, and cello, as well as keyboard instruments such as the organ and harpsichord. The Amati, Guarneri, and Stradivari families of Cremona, Italy, established techniques for crafting high-quality violins sought throughout Europe.

Three main composition types characterized seventeenth-century instrumental music: the sonata, the suite, and the concerto. The sonata, derived from the Italian word for "sounded," is a piece written for a few instruments, typically consisting of three movements. The suite is a series of movements derived from European court or folk dances, with composers like Henry Purcell, Francois Couperin, and Johann Sebastian Bach contributing to its development. The concerto, with a name rooted in contrasting bodies of sound, features two groups of instruments playing in dialogue, with the concerto grosso as a typical baroque form.
