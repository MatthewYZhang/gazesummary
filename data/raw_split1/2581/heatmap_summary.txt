In the last half of the sixteenth century, England emerged as a commercial and manufacturing power in Europe due to a combination of demographic, agricultural, and industrial factors. England's population grew from about 2.5 million in the 1520s to over 3.5 million in 1580, reaching about 4.5 million in 1610. Reduced mortality rates and increased fertility, possibly generated by expanding work opportunities in manufacturing and farming, explained this rapid rise. Epidemics and plague occurred occasionally, but England suffered less than continental Europe. The country was pulled out of the war that occurred in France and central Europe during the same period. The prominent example of Englandâ€™s agricultural expansion well before the European agricultural revolution. English agriculture became more efficient and market-oriented. The great land estates largely remained intact and many wealthy land owners aggressively increased the size of their holdings, a precondition for increased productivity. Textile manufacturing transformed the English economy.
