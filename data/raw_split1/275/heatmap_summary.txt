Symbiotic relationships involve interactions between species where one lives in or on another. These relationships are parasitism, commensalism, and mutualism, and they influence biological community structure. Parasitism is a predator-prey relationship where a parasite obtains food at the host's expense. Parasites are usually smaller than their hosts. For example, a tapeworm lives in an animal's intestines and absorbs nutrients. Natural selection favors parasites that find and feed on hosts. Hosts develop defensive abilities like plants producing toxic chemicals against fungal and bacterial parasites, which sometimes also protect against predatory animals. Vertebrates use immune systems against internal parasites. Australia's rabbit population, devastated by the deliberate introduction of the myxoma virus in 1950, rebounded as natural selection favored resistant rabbits and less deadly virus strains, stabilizing the host-parasite relationship. The complex interplay of species in symbiotic relationships highlights that community structure depends on a web of diverse connections among organisms.
