In 1912, Alfred Wegener proposed the theory of continental drift, suggesting that Earth’s continents are mobile rafts shifting over time. This theory was motivated by the apparent fit of the coastlines of South America and Africa. Wegener maintained that Earth is composed of concentric shells, with continents made of lighter rock called sial floating in the denser sima underlying the oceans. He proposed that all the continents had been joined in the supercontinent of Pangaea. As Pangaea broke up, the pieces moved apart, forming islands and mountain ranges where they collided. Wegener also proposed that mountains were thrust up either by the plowing of the continents through the sima, as in the case of the Andes, or by the colliding of two blocks of sial, as in the case of the Himalayas. As for the force driving continental drift, Wegener initially invoked Polfluchtkraft—a force causing flight from the poles as a result of Earth’s rotation—and later the tidal force resulting from the gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon and Sun. Wegener also supported evidence in ancient climates, indicating that the past climate of many regions was much different from the present climate.
