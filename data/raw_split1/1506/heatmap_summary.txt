In the 20th century, political systems varied. Monarchy, a government with a hereditary ruler, declined from global dominance to a handful of states. While monarchs remained symbolic in Europe, power shifted to constitutional assemblies. Autocratic monarchy became outdated, with citizens replacing subjects. Liberal democracy, with authority resting in elected representatives, emerged where monarchy was removed. These states generally follow the parliamentary pattern, with the executive power vested in a cabinet. Popular sovereignty became the basis for democratic states, with citizenship rights extended to formerly excluded groups. However, democratic states expanded their role to control economic power and provide services. The number of laws increased significantly, particularly in social welfare, education, and economic development. Totalitarian dictatorships emerged as democratic governments failed. These dictatorships replaced popular sovereignty with the power of the state. Authoritarian governments are generally led by a leader with exceptional powers and supported by a party.
