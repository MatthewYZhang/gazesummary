Wind pollination involves pollen, a powdery substance produced by flowering plants and containing male reproductive cells, being carried from plant to plant by the wind. This method is considered primitive and wasteful due to the large amount of pollen required. However, it is surprisingly common, especially in higher latitudes, as the wind can transport pollen over considerable distances.

Wind pollination is likened to sending a letter to a friend by throwing it from a roof, emphasizing its unspecific nature. In temperate forests, where the same species of trees are concentrated, wind pollination is more effective. Conversely, in the tropics, where tree species are scattered, animals are more reliable pollinators. Wind-pollinated flowers do not need bright petals, nectar, and scent, which are unnecessary for attracting insects and might hinder pollen transfer.

Wind pollination requires a significant amount of pollen, such as the millions of grains produced by birch and hazel trees per catkin. Deciduous wind-pollinated trees release pollen in the spring when branches are bare, reducing competition for pollen. Evergreen conifers, on the other hand, have less advantage from spring flowering and may bloom in the autumn or winter.

Pollen produced higher in the top branches is more likely to travel farther due to windier conditions. Dangling catkins, like those of hazel, hold pollen until the wind is strong enough to disperse it. Weather is important, and pollen is released when the air is dry to avoid sticking to wet surfaces or being washed away by rain.
