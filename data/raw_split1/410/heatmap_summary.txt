In the late thirteenth century, northern Italian cities such as Genoa, Florence, and Venice began an economic resurgence, becoming important economic centers. However, by the seventeenth century, other European powers took over, and Italian cities lost economic power.

This decline affected Venetian shipping and trade. Venice's intermediary functions in the Adriatic Sea were lost to direct trading. Though guilds required to provide rowers and through a draft system free citizens served compulsorily, there was a shortage of crews proved to be a greater problem despite continuous appeal to Venic’s tradition of maritime greatness. Even though sailors’ wages doubled among the northern Italian cities from 1550 to 1590, this did not elicit an increased supply.

The problem in shipping extended to the Arsenale, Venice’s huge and powerful shipyard. Timber ran short, and it was necessary to procure it from farther and farther away. Private shipbuilders were required to buy their oak abroad. As the costs of shipbuilding rose, Venice clung to its outdated standard while the Dutch were innovation in the lighter and more easily handled ships. Complaints arose in the late sixteenth century about the standards of the Arsenale declining, and the shipbuilding industry struggled to recover after ship losses in battle.

The conventional explanation for the decline of Venetian trade is the Portuguese direct sea route to the East. Venice had lost its monopoly in markets. Venetian shipping was clearly outclassed by the end of the century because of conservatism and loss of expertise.
