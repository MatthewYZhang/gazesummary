Teotihuac치n, located about 50 kilometers northeast of modern-day Mexico City, grew from 200-100 B.C., reaching its height between A.D. 150 and 700. At its peak, the city had a population exceeding 125,000 and spanned over 20 square kilometers, comprising more than 2,000 apartment complexes, a large market, numerous industrial workshops, an administrative center, massive religious structures, and a structured grid of streets and buildings. The city demonstrated economic and possibly religious links with much of Mesoamerica.

The valley, similar to numerous regions in the Mexican and Guatemalan highlands, was abundant in obsidian. The long-distance trade in obsidian likely afforded Teotihuac치n's elite inhabitants access to exotic goods and a relatively prosperous life. The thriving obsidian operation, for example, would necessitate more miners, additional manufacturers of obsidian tools, and additional traders to carry the goods to new markets. All this led to increased wealth, which in turn would attract more immigrants to Teotihuac치n. The growing power of the elite, who controlled the economy, would give them the means to physically coerce people to move to Teotihuac치n and serve as additions to the labor force.
