Bird colonies are a nesting strategy employed by about 13 percent of bird species. Colonial nesting evolves as a response to limited safe nesting sites and unpredictable food sources. Colonies offer protection from predators, especially on islands, where birds detect predators more quickly. The yellow-rumped cacique demonstrates predator avoidance through nesting on islands and near wasp nests. They also work together to mob predators and hide nests. In addition to protection from predators, colonies offer social benefits. Synchronized nesting provides an abundance of food for the local predators and colonial neighbors can enhance their foraging through observation. American cliff swallows use colonies as information centers to locate good feeding sites. Colonies must be located near rich food supplies such as seed-rich conifer forests. However, colonial nesting can lead to competition for resources and an increase in parasites. The advantages of colonial nesting generally outweigh the disadvantages.
