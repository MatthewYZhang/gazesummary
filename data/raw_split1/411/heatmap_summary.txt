The evolutionary history of plants is marked by adaptations, evolving from photosynthetic single-celled organisms similar to algae. Early plants lacked true roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, which appeared later. Green algae are likely most similar to ancestral plants, supported by phylogenetic and DNA evidence. Plants evolved from green algae and shared the same type of chlorophyll and accessory pigments in photosynthesis. Green algae, like land plants, store food as starch and have cellulose cell walls. Ancient freshwater green algae evolved features to withstand temperature extremes and dryness, aiding their invasion of land.

When plants pioneered the land, they faced challenges due to the absence of water's buoyancy and the drying effects of air. This favored the evolution of supportive structures, vessels for transporting water and nutrients, and water-conserving structures. Adaptations included roots, a waxy cuticle, and stomata. The development of waterless sex cell dispersal and protected embryos were achieved with the origin of seed plants and their key innovations: pollen, seeds, and flowers.
