Since their discovery in 1879, cave paintings at Altamira have led scholars to ponder the purpose of the animal images in dark caverns. The remoteness and difficulty of accessing the cave paintings, combined with their usage over centuries, suggest the prehistoric hunters attributed magical properties to the painted images. Some argue that by confining animals to cave walls, the artists believed they were controlling the beasts, while others propose rituals or dances were performed to improve hunters' luck. Still others suggest that the painted animals served as teaching tools. Representations of human hands are also common, painted using both "negative" and "positive" techniques. One of the horses may have been inspired by the rock formation in the wall surface resembling a horse's head and neck. Old Stone Age painters and sculptors frequently and skillfully used the caves' naturally irregular surfaces to help give the illusion of real presence to their forms. Altamira bison, for example, were painted over bulging rock surfaces. Bison and cattle appear almost exclusively on convex surfaces, whereas nearly all horses and hands are painted on concave surfaces.
