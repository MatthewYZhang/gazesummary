Seaweeds, multicellular algae inhabiting oceans, share common aspects in biology and ecological contributions despite evolutionary distances. Most are benthic, growing on various seafloor materials, with some attaching selectively. They generally occupy about 2% of the seafloor. The presence of benthic seaweeds defines the inner continental shelf, crucially supporting the marine community, contrasting with the outer shelf and deep sea. The distinction between inner and outer shelves relies on the compensation depth of algae, where photosynthesis equals respiration.

The environmental factors governing seaweed distribution are light and temperature. Vertical and horizontal seaweed distributions are limited by sunlight, varying with depth, latitude, sea conditions, and season. The idea that vertical distribution of red, brown, and green algae is dictated by photosynthetic pigments was once accepted. However, the chromatic adaptation concept was challenged, suggesting herbivory, competition, specialized pigments, and growth adjustments affect distribution. Temperature impacts distribution; algal diversity is greatest in tropical waters. At high latitudes, freezing and scouring by ice may eliminate seaweeds from the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones.
