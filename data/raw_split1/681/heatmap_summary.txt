Seagrasses are aquatic flowering plants that thrive in shallow sea bottoms, with seagrass beds heavily influenced by physical factors, particularly water motion such as currents and waves. Seagrass systems exist in both sheltered and open areas, and they are subject to varying degrees of water motion. In relatively turbulent waters, seagrass meadows tend to form mosaics of individual mounds, while in calmer waters, they form flat, extensive carpets. Seagrass beds dampen wave action, especially when blades reach the surface, and this effect can be significant, reducing wave motion to zero just one meter into the bed. Currents are also slowed as they move into the bed.

The accumulation of sediment in seagrass beds is influenced by wave action and currents, with stronger currents removing lighter particles and weaker currents accumulating detrital material. Ultimately, they accumulate organic material, leading to fine-grained sediments with high organic content, thus reducing water movement and oxygen supply. Other physical factors impacting seagrass beds include light, temperature, and desiccation. While temperature was initially thought to be critical for eelgrass growth, it can survive in a wide range of temperatures, from Arctic waters to the northeastern coast of the United States.
