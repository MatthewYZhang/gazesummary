Cosmologists seek to comprehend the origin and structure of the universe, beginning with the assumption that the universe appears the same to any observer, regardless of location. This is the cosmological principle, supported by the observation that galaxies and clusters are distributed uniformly in all directions within the reach of telescopes. A key observation is that the universe is expanding; distant galaxies move away from each other.

Until the 1960s, the primary cosmological fact was the expansion of the universe, explained by two main theories: the evolutionary (Big Bang) theory and the steady-state theory. Quasars, distant objects, provide a window into the universe's past, revealing the state of the universe billions of years ago. The fact that quasars are far away shows that their development was more frequent earlier in the universe's history.  This evolution aligns with the Big Bang theory, but not with the steady-state view.
