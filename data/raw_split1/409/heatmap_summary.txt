The surface of Mars displays a variety of geological features, including substantial impact cratering and vast volcanoes. The Tharsis bulge, a large geological region near Mars's equator, features three large volcanoes. Olympus Mons, the largest volcano, has a height of 25 kilometers and measures 700 kilometers in diameter at its base. The other three volcanoes on the Tharsis bulge are a "mere" 18 kilometers high. These volcanoes are shield volcanoes with broad, sloping slides formed by molten rock. The four volcanoes feature distinctive lava channels and other flow characteristics comparable to those seen on Earth's shield volcanoes. The Martian surface shows hundreds of volcanoes.

The ejecta around the lunar crater is what one might anticipate from an explosion that releases a lot of dust, dirt, and boulders. The ejecta on Mars, however, gives the unmistakable impression of a liquid that has spilled or streamed from the crater. Geologists believe that this fluidized ejecta crater indicates the existence of a permafrost or water ice layer just a few meters beneath the surface. Explosive impacts warmed and liquefied the ice, giving the ejecta a fluid look.
