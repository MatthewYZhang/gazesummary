Aboriginal rock art has drawn interest since European exploration of Australia. By the late nineteenth century, awareness grew, with intensified efforts in the twentieth century to record and comprehend this art. The systematic study of this art is a relatively new discipline in Australia. The most significant data have come from a concentration on three major questions: the age, stylistic organization and is it possible to interpret accurately the subject matter of ancient rock art, bring to bear all available archaeological techniques and the knowledge of present-day Aboriginal informants?. Reliable scientific evidence dates the earliest creation of art on rock surfaces in Australia to somewhere between 30,000 and 50,000 years ago. The sequences and meanings of its images have been widely debated. Since the mid-1970s, a reasonably stable picture has formed of the organization of Australian rock art. Researchers have relied on a distinction between geometric and figurative elements. Simple geometric repeated patterns are the iconography of the earliest sites. The frequency of certain motifs led to the term "Panaramitee style". The archaeologist Lesley Maynard suggested a sequence in which geometric style gave way to figurative style.
