Fluids, such as liquids and gases, are substances whose particles can move past each other, conforming to the shape of their containers. On planets with a hydrosphere and atmosphere, fluids can drastically alter the planet's surface. Venus and Earth, often regarded as twin planets, have evolved differently due to their distance from the Sun. Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but it lost its water because the Sunâ€™s ultraviolet rays broke the molecules apart. Consequently, it became less like Earth and developed a carbon dioxide-filled atmosphere, leading to high temperatures and prohibiting carbonate minerals. Volcanoes kept venting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On Earth, liquid water removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming carbonate sedimentary rocks. The Earth's distance from the Sun allows water to exist in multiple states and move rapidly in a continuous hydrologic cycle. The surface has been continually changed and eroded by water and wind. Liquid water allowed life to develop, modifying Earth's surface and atmosphere.
