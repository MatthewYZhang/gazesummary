Seasonal succession refers to the change in dominant phytoplankton species from season to season. This phenomenon occurs in various locations, with one or more species dominating for a period before being replaced, repeating yearly. This contrasts with terrestrial succession, where a climax community persists.

Several factors contribute to seasonal succession. Temperature changes, especially in temperate seas, have been suggested as a cause, though temperature changes slowly in seawater and the replacement of species can be much more rapid. Also, nutrient level changes throughout the year can favor certain species, but phytoplankton populations rise and fall quicker than nutrient concentrations change.

Another explanation involves changes in seawater caused by phytoplankton themselves. They secrete organic molecules, or metabolites, which can either inhibit or promote the growth of other organisms. These include toxins released by dinoflagellates during red tides, which inhibit the growth of other photosynthetic organisms. Another class of metabolite is vitamins. Certain phytoplankton species require certain vitamins, and species succession can occur when vitamin-producing species are followed by vitamin-requiring species. In addition, grazers can also influence phytoplankton species composition. Ultimately, all factors may be operating simultaneously.
