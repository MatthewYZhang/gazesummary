The nineteenth century witnessed significant shifts in the economics of printed materials in both the United States and Europe. These changes happened earlier and on a wider basis in America. The advent of cheap print was highlighted by sharp reductions in the prices for newspapers and books. The "penny press" and the "dime novel", were named for their low price. The information-price revolution also affected religious and political publishing, and reading became a basis of mass persuasion for the first time in history.

Cheap print was not entirely unprecedented as cheap collections of stories had circulated among the lower classes in England and France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Expansion of cheap print was on a much larger scale in the nineteenth century in America and Europe. Reading became more varied with the explosion of print. The expansion of print created an incentive for technological innovation. The industrialization of book production proceeded more rapidly in the United States.
