Geographic isolation of species is a key event in the origin of many species, which involves separating a population with its gene pool from other populations of the same species. This prevents population interbreeding, allowing the isolated population to follow its own evolutionary course. This mode of evolving new species is called allopatric speciation.

Many factors can geographically isolate a population, such as mountain ranges, glaciers, or land bridges. However, the effectiveness of a geographic barrier depends on the ability of organisms to move across it. Birds and coyotes can easily cross barriers, while small rodents may find a deep canyon or wide river to be effective.

Geographic isolation creates opportunities for new species to develop, but speciation occurs only when the gene pool undergoes enough changes to establish reproductive barriers. The likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is small and isolated. For example, small populations that colonized the Galapagos Islands gave rise to all the species that now inhabit the islands. Similarly, the species on the Galapagos Islands descended from organisms that arrived from the South American mainland, such as the thirteen species of Galapagos finches. These finches evolved from a single ancestral population, with later dispersions leading to new species on different islands.
