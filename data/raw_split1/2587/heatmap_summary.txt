Europe's economy began to decline around 1300 after three centuries of impressive gains. One of the most important factors contributing to this decline was a shift in climate. The remarkably fair weather of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries worsened in the fourteenth, leading to an approximate two-degree Celsius decline in Europe's average annual temperature.

The temperature drop shortened the summer growing season and affected the resilience of vegetable species, which led to decreased crop yields and the contraction of the agricultural economy. As food supplies dwindled, costs rose accordingly, cutting into the amount of capital available for purchases or investments. Another cause of the sputtering economy was the lack of changes in agricultural technology, where food production fell perilously close to subsistence levels. 

The cycle of indebtedness entangled even whole governments, such as England, where many banks collapsed. As economic forces made agrarian life more perilous around 1300, hard-pressed farmers began to migrate to the cities in large numbers in search of work.
