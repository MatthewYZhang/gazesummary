In the 19th century, America's construction heavily relied on wood, particularly pine, prized for its durability, workability, and buoyancy. This allowed for transportation to distant markets from the extensive pine forests of the Great Lakes states—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota—via large rivers. By 1860, westward expansion and timber shortages in the East led to significant lumbering in the Great Lakes region, transforming it into a large enterprise. Newly formed corporations systematically cut trees, with lumbering between 1860 and 1890 showing a break from the past.

Technological advancements also propelled the commercialization of lumbering. The shift to thinner-blade band saws reduced wood wastage, while steam-powered mills centralized and streamlined production. These steam-powered mills also automated tasks, making year-round lumber production possible by preventing the freezing of log ponds.
However, the impact of weather created a challenge for the lumber industry. Traditional winter logging on sleds required specific conditions, which loggers addressed by experimenting with methods like sprinkling water on sleigh roads to create artificial ice. In the face of snowless winters, lumber companies sought alternative solutions, such as railroads, to ensure continuous operation. By 1887, many logging railroads had been built, transforming logging into a year-round activity. Logjams became common, so barriers called booms were constructed to help keep the logs moving efficiently. By the 1870s, lumber companies existed in all the major logging areas of the northern Midwest.
