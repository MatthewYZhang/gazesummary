The timing of flowering and seed production is precisely tuned to a plant's physiology. In temperate climates, plants flower early enough so that their seeds can mature before the deadly winds of autumn. Depending on how quickly the seed and food develop, flowering may occur in spring, summer, or even in autumn. Botanists classify plants as day neutral, long day, or short day plants. Short night plants, such as spinach, flower when the length of darkness is shorter than a species' specific critical period, and long night plants, like cockleburs, flower when the length of uninterrupted darkness is longer than the species' critical period. Plants measure continuous darkness with a metabolic clock and a light-detecting system. They use the phytochrome system in combination with their internal biological clocks to detect the duration of continuous darkness. Interrupting the middle of the dark period with even a minute or two of light prevents flowering, and even brief exposure to sunlight or white light can reset their biological clocks.
