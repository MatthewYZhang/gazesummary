Speech is primary, and writing is secondary, which is one of the basic assumptions of modern linguistics. Writing is the representation of speech in another physical medium. Writing is a three-stage process: thinking of an idea, expressing it in mental grammar, and then transferring it to written form. It is important to remember that even though the written form can be nearly immediate these days, there is still an extra step between conceptualizing the message you want to communicate and the reception of that idea if you have to write it. Archeological evidence indicates that writing was first utilized in Sumer, that is, modern-day Iraq, about 6,000 years ago. Spoken language has probably been used by humans for hundreds of thousands of years. Writing must be taught, whereas spoken language is acquired automatically. Writing systems vary in complexity, but regardless of their level of sophistication, they must all be taught. Writing can be edited, and so the product of writing is usually more aptly worded and better organized. This "perfection of writing" can be explained by the fact that writing is the result of deliberation, correction, and revision. Writing tends to last, because of its physical medium and can be preserved for a very long time.
