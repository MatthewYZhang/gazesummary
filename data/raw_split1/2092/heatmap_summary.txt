About 13 percent of bird species nest in colonies, which evolves due to a shortage of safe nesting sites and unpredictable food sources. Colonial nesting provides advantages such as increased safety from predators and the ability to detect predators more quickly.

The yellow-rumped cacique in Amazonian Peru uses three methods to prevent predation: nesting near wasp nests for protection from mammals, mobbing predators as a group, and mixing active nests with abandoned ones to hide them.

Colonial neighbors can improve their foraging by observing others, especially when food supplies are limited. American cliff swallows use colonies as information centers, with unsuccessful birds following successful neighbors to food sources. This information sharing enhances foraging efficiency, allowing parent swallows in large colonies to bring food to their nestlings more often. However, nesting in large colonies may cause increased competition, exhaustion of food supplies, and increased risks of parasites.

Suitable colony sites must be near rich, clumped food supplies. The guanay cormorants depend on the productive cold waters of the Humboldt Current, but their populations decline during El Nino years when food supplies decrease.
