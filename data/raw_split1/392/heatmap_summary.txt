Water enters a lake from inflowing rivers, underwater seeps and springs, overland flow, and rain. It leaves through outflowing rivers, soaking into the bed, and evaporation. Determining actual water volumes involves measuring inputs and outputs of streams and rivers, along with atmospheric exchanges, which are calculated using rain gauges and models for evaporation. For lakes surrounded by forests, overland flow has a small impact. Changes in lake level are due to the net difference between groundwater seepage.

A lake's flow can be surface-water or seepage-dominated. A steady water level without streams indicates seepage domination, while a stream-fed pond that dries up is surface-water dominated. A lake constantly gains and loses water, leading to the concept of residence time, which is the average time a water molecule stays in the lake, calculated by dividing the volume of water by the outflow rate.  Residence times for the Great Lakes of North America, namely, Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are, respectively, 190,100,22,2.5, and 6 years. Climate change is impacting residence times, such as in northwestern Ontario, where decreased rainfall and increased evapotranspiration have lengthened residence times. This slowing water renewal concentrates dissolved chemicals, affecting lake life.
