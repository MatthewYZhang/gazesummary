The periodic table is a chart reflecting the periodic recurrence of elements' chemical and physical properties when the elements are arranged by increasing atomic number. By the late 1860s, over 60 elements had been identified, and proposals were made to arrange elements into groups based on property similarities. The order of the groups in this sequence was fixed and repeated itself at regular intervals.  Elements of the same groups were automatically assembled in vertical columns in a periodic table. Lothar Meyer and Dmitry Mendeleyev introduced the periodic table in 1869-70, even though one-third of the elements were undiscovered. Both chemists left gaps for new elements based on property analyses. Mendeleyev predicted the properties of six undiscovered elements, such as "eka-aluminum," whose properties matched gallium when it was discovered. Support for the periodic law grew with the discovery of eka-silicon (germanium). John William Strut and Lord Rayleigh discovered argon, a gaseous element that didn't fit the existing classification scheme. Together with William Ramsay, they isolated argon. Ramsay also discovered helium, previously known only in the Sun's spectrum. Rayleigh and Ramsay postulated a new group of elements, and in 1898, neon, krypton, and xenon were isolated.
