Moscow's rise during medieval times marked a fundamental development in Russian history, despite its initial insignificance compared to principalities like Novgorod or Galicia. Historians have identified several factors contributing to Moscow's ascent.

One factor is the doctrine of geographic causation, emphasizing Moscow's location for the expansion of the Muscovite state. The city sat at the crossing of three roads, including the path from Kiev and the south to the northeast, serving as the first stopping point in the northeast. Moscow was situated on a bend of the Moscow River, connecting to the Volga River, and near the headwaters of the Oka, Volga, Don, and Dnieper rivers, offering opportunities for expansion. Moscow benefited from its central position, cushioned from outside invaders compared to cities like Novgorod.

The economic argument is linked to geography, with the Moscow River serving as a trade artery and the Muscovite principality promoting economic intercourse. The success of the Muscovite princes in agriculture, colonization, and maintaining peace contributed to economic life. The role of Moscow's rulers is also a key factor, with Moscow fortunate in its princes, who benefited from male succession and avoided conflicts.
