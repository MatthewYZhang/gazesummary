Cetaceans, including whales, porpoises, and dolphins, are mammals that breathe through lungs and give birth to live young. While their streamlined bodies, absence of hind legs, and presence of a fluke and blowhole may obscure the connection, they share affinities with land-dwelling mammals. It was not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. However, fossils of extinct but fully marine cetaceans are known. In 1979, the oldest fossil whale, Pakicetus, was found in northern Pakistan. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea. In 1989, Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert. In 1994, the now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans ("the walking whale that swam") lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea.
