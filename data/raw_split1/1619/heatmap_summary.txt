Population ecology studies changes in population size and composition, identifying the factors causing these shifts, including environmental conditions. A population consists of individuals of a single species in a specific area, influenced by environmental factors and interactions. Population size is balanced by factors that increase numbers, such as favorable light and temperature, adequate food, suitable habitat, and adaptation. Factors that decrease populations include insufficient resources or inability to adapt to changes, and competition for resources. Ecologists rarely count all individuals and use sampling or indirect indicators to estimate total sizes. A population's density is the number of individuals per unit area, and dispersion reflects the pattern of spacing among individuals. Population dispersion can be clumped, uniform, or random, with clumped dispersion resulting from resource distribution, while uniform distribution results from interactions like competition. Random dispersion is rare and occurs in the absence of attraction or repulsion. Populations change in response to environmental conditions, with birth and death rates being the primary means by which populations adjust to resource availability.
