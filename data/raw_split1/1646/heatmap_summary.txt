The medium is the means by which an art form presents its message, for example, paint on canvas or paper in painting. For theater, the medium is a story performed by actors on a stage. Unlike a novel, a play is written to be performed, and the script is an outline for a performance. The physical production, including scenery, lighting, and costumes, along with the actors' interpretations, affects the play's effect on the audience.

The subject matter of theater is always human beings, and the urge to create drama has existed wherever human society has developed, from Europe to the Americas. Rituals and ceremonies have evolved into separate realms of theater, with evidence of developed theater in Greece around 2,500 years ago and in India around 2,000 years ago. A special quality of theater performance is its immediacy, making it a transitory art that is distinct from literature and visual arts. Theater occurs through time as an experience created by a series of sights, sounds, and impressions.
