Most people believe landscapes are unchanging, but Earth's surface is constantly changing. Two key influences shape the terrain: constructive processes like uplift that create new features and destructive forces like erosion that gradually wear away landforms. Mountains, though often seen as permanent, are short-lived geologically. Higher mountains are more recent, such as the Himalayas, which are about 50 million years old, while lower mountains tend to be older, often being relics of higher chains. For instance, the Caledonian mountain chain, once comparable to the Himalayas, exists today as low mountains in Greenland and other regions.

Mountains are formed as a result of plates crashing and forcing the rock up, earthquakes, or volcanic activity. As soon as land rises above sea level it is subjected to destructive forces. The weather is the main agent of erosion. Rain and wind break down rocks, glaciers erode valleys, and even living things play a role in shaping landscapes.
