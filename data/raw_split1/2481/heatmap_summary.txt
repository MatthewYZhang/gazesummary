The development of the centralized dynasties in ancient China was influenced by its terrain and climate, and it was relatively isolated. Chinese civilization was greatly influenced by the Yellow River region and the loess. The river's tendency to clog its own course led to dikes breaking and causing significant floods. This problem has a historical origin dating back to at least the Spring and Autumn period. In 652 B.C., Duke Huan of Qi convened a league of states where they mutually pledged "not to execute improper dikes" and "not to hinder the water flow." Furthermore, the effect of monsoon rain on agriculture also compelled China to proceed to an early national unification and to follow it with political centralization. Lastly, in times of bad weather, nomads had a tendency to execute large-scale invasions, thus Chinese put the regional and local government under a strong center, allowing national defense to dictate a degree of homogeneity and uniformity.
