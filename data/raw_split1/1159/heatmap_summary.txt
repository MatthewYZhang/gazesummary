The environmental movement in the US gained momentum in the late 1960s due to growing concerns about pollution and the negative impacts of development, especially polluted air and water. In May 1970, the first Earth Day celebration was held to raise awareness of environmental problems, becoming a regular annual event. During the 1950s and 1960s, the environmental movement focused on restoring the cleanliness of air and water supplies, preserving unique lands, and protecting endangered species. This grass roots movement led to the passage of key laws like the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, and National Environmental Policy Act, forming the foundation for environmental standards in the US. President Nixon established the EPA, which has played a significant role in protecting and restoring the environment. While environmental protection has faced criticism, with some arguing that predictions of environmental damage have been exaggerated, the environmental movement continues to have broad support, as demonstrated by the environmental legislation that exists.
