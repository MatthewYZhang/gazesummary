The environmental movement in the US traces its roots back to the nineteenth century when nature lovers sought to protect natural areas. It was during the late 1960s that environmental concerns reached mainstream political debate as Americans recognized the downsides of unchecked development, like polluted air and water. The first Earth Day celebration in May 1970 was a pivotal event that raised awareness and became an annual tradition.

During the 1950s and 1960s, industrial and vehicle pollution had become a serious threat to public health, so the environmental movement focused on restoring and ensuring the cleanliness of basic air and water supplies.

President Nixon established the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to protect the environment, which spearheaded numerous contemporary efforts and earned credit for restoring the environment. Private advocacy groups, the EPA, state legislatures, and Congress collaborated on laws regarding air and water quality, land use, and waste management, showing broad support for the movement.
