Memphis, founded around 3100 B.C. as the first capital of a united Egypt, was strategically located at the Nile's apex, making it an ideal administrative center between Upper and Lower Egypt. This location facilitated access to both parts of the country, especially because older power centers like Hierakonpolis were too distant from the delta, which had been incorporated into the unified state. Memphis was also crucial for transport and communications, serving as a conduit for river-based trade between northern and southern Egypt. Royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt utilized Memphis to channel commodities such as wine, precious oils, and metals imported from the Near East, contributing to an ideal location for controlling internal trade. Recent geological surveys indicate that Memphis was advantageously located for controlling trade, transport, and communications. Furthermore, the Memphis region seems to have been favorably located for the control not only of river-based trade but also of desert trade routes.
