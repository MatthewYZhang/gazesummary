As the first cities formed in Mesopotamia, agricultural production necessitated finding ways of obtaining sufficient water, leading to irrigation development. Canals and their intakes required labor to maintain. With irrigation water also came potential problems, including flooding and salinization. Salinization is caused by the accumulation of salt in the soil near its surface, deposited by river water. Evaporation concentrates the salts, and excessive irrigation brings the water table to the root zone, where the high concentration of salts would kill most plants. Solutions for salinization included leaching the fields with additional fresh water and digging deep wells to lower the water table. Growing agrarian societies also tried to meet their food-producing needs by farming less-desirable hill slopes. The most direct solution to the problem of slope runoff was to lay lines of stones along the contours of the slope and hence, perpendicular to the probable flow of water and sediment. These stones could then act as small dams.
