A major question in the archaeology of the southwestern region of the United States is why so many settlements were abandoned. Archaeologist Tim Kohler has suggested that human-environmental interaction was an important reason in the case of the Anasazi people. The actual case study that Kohler relies on is from the Dolores River basin of southwest Colorado, where the Anasazi seem to have moved in about A.D. 600. By about A.D. 900 the area began to be abandoned due to short growing seasons impacting corn production. However, Kohler assets that a growing population led to human-environmental interactions that caused people to live in villages, intensify agrarian food production, deforest the region, deplete the local soils, and ultimately abandon the area. One key indicator is the wood used, showing a decline in juniper and pinon use, replaced by woody shrubs and fast-growing cottonwood. Fewer pinon trees were used, and old pinon trees were used while juniper trees continued to be from young trees. The forest was changing to more junipers and less pinon, putting an additional nutritional strain on the population. As time went on, there was a substantial increase in seeds from pioneer plants, attesting both to agricultural intensification and to an increasingly disturbed local environment. Kohler's interpretation is that by about A.D. 840, people had aggregated into villages. The Anasazi responded to this by further intensification, such as water-control mechanisms. A reliance on the management of resources through cooperative action reduced their flexibility of action, so that when poor seasons occurred, people were seriously hurt. Thus an expectable aberration in the climatic regime may have been enough to cause the collapse of the village system in the Dolores area.
