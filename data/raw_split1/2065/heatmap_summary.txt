As cities formed in Mesopotamia around 3000 B.C., increasing agricultural production was crucial, leading to the need for sufficient water. Irrigation started small, evolving to divert water into canals and extend canal systems, necessitating maintenance labor and water allocation decisions. Irrigation, however, brought flooding and salinization, with salinization being caused by the accumulation of salt near the soil surface. This salt is carried by river water and deposited on Mesopotamian fields during flooding or irrigation. Evaporation concentrates salts, which descend to the water table, potentially harming plants. Solutions included leaching fields with fresh water, digging wells, or leaving fields uncultivated, each with drawbacks. Growing societies turned to less-desirable hill slopes. In extreme conditions, almost half the water being carried away by runoff. The solution was to lay stones along the slope contours to slow water flow and allow soil particles to collect, improving water retention.
