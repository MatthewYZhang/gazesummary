Writing history is fraught with pitfalls for historians. Those focusing on Africa face unique challenges, especially concerning the scarcity of written records in medieval African societies south of the Sahara, save for Ethiopia, Sudan, and east coast cities. Surviving texts from Greek, Roman, Amharic, Fulani, and Swahili offer limited insights. Future discoveries are anticipated in North Africa and countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia.  However, the preservation of old documents in tropical climates is hindered by white ants and humidity, leading to substantial material loss.

The lack of written material, such as memoirs or administrative archives, poses a significant problem for historians. While administrative files possess a unique value due to their origin in executive transactions, their reliability is not guaranteed. Yet, unlike biased biographies, archival evidence often holds authenticity. Where writing is absent, accurate descriptions are difficult to achieve, relying on speculative extrapolations. To compensate, some historians turn to indigenous traditions, folklore, and personal reminiscences. However, oral history presents its own challenges. The same document can be reviewed repeatedly, but informants cannot be interviewed multiple times without introducing subjectivity. Memories are also subject to alteration.

Oral traditions can provide valuable insights into a people's culture and factual foundations. They also help historians in posing new questions. However, oral traditions are hard to interpret and requires corroboration, as they cannot stand alone as authoritative sources.
