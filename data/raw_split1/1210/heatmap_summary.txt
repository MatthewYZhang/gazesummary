The crown of thorns starfish, Acanthaster Tlanci, is a large starfish that feeds primarily on coral. Since the mid-1950s, population outbreaks at densities four to six times greater than normal have occurred. The result has often been the loss of a fifty percent to nearly one hundred percent of the coral cover over large areas.

A single Acanthaster can consume five to six square meters of coral polyps per year, and dense populations can destroy up to six square kilometers per year and move on rapidly. Acanthasters show a preference for branching corals, especially Acroporids, causing their selective removal in outbreak areas.

Two schools of thought exist concerning the cause of these outbreaks, some pointing to natural phenomena, others to human activities. The hypotheses include those related to adult aggregation following storms and the increased abundance of Acanthaster after episodes of high terrestrial runoff. One theory connects these outbreaks to terrestrial runoff, with low salinity, high temperatures, and increased nutrients favoring starfish larvae survival. These conditions come from strong freshwater runoff, which promotes rapid larval development. Those favoring human influence attribute the outbreaks to the destruction of coral polyps and the removal of predators. It is likely that multiple factors, including natural processes and human impacts, contribute to these outbreaks.
